# Description

A thin, emasculated figure, Bezaliel is clad in deep red clothing that looks black in darkness. His features are obscured by a hood, though a very thin mouth is visible beneath it. Above the cowl, at eye level, a waning crescent moon is suspended.

Bezaliel exists in service of Leira, Chaotic goddess of trickery and illusion.
