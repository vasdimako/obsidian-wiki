# History

Dol Arrah was a beacon of light and hope, representing all good in the mortal soul. While the primeval gods remained aloof and mysterious, Dol Arrah walked the Material Plane and taught mortals to harness their infinite ingenuity and kindness. She was a spear and shield against extraplanar forces that would enslave the budding races, and she was consort to Corellon Larethian.

She had many names - Dawnbringer, Inspiration's Dawn, Lady of Order and Sacrifice, the Radiant Spear.

# Mythology

The mythology circulated within Dol Arrah's church still survives within some ancient scrolls preserved in elven libraries. She is said to have appeared to a group of humans in the darkest hours of night and taught them to harness the light and warmth of fire. Through fire and hearth, she guided the races to gather and form structured society with light, goodness and altruism at its core. This was during a time when the Primordial Gods generally thought mortals beneath their notice, and Dol Arrah was the primary goddess to be worshipped by the mortal races. The Primordials eventually noticed Dol Arrah's efforts and were displeased by her elevating mortals, but they soon found that their own domains had a place in mortal hearts. The concept of religion grew. During this time, Dol Arrah was said to walk among mortals in the form of a dark-skinned woman with short, white hair and a kindly, weathered face, a healer and oracle.

After Dol Arrah was satisfied that the other gods would watch over the races, she took a step back from the Material Plane and left mortal affairs to her clerics and acolytes. She was not seen again, but her faithful claimed to have visions of her picking up her spear and shield and donning the helm and mantle of Defender of the Material Plane from extraplanar threats. The Church of Dol Arrah's main tenet remained the bringing of light, hope and goodness to dark and evil places, but more and more blessed paladins of the goddess appeared in this time. They bore a burning, cleansing light that destroyed those who would do humanity har. The teachings of the church resonated with many, and Dol Arrah was worshipped fervently as a defender and bringer of hope.

There is a distinct lack of stories of Dol Arrah's activity during the Hundred-Year War. Even as the gods' battle shattered the world, the faithful of Dol Arrah found she no longer responded to their prayers, and her clerics' powers failed them when they most needed them. Some thought that Dol Arrah was disappointed with the other gods' bloodthirst and abandoned her faithful to another world, while others were certain her light would return again at the darkest moment. Each day that she did not return, more and more of her acolytes lost faith and abandoned her temples. It is written that the last few were driven out of her holy temples by a plague of rats and other vermin, and the shrines were left to crumple to dust.
