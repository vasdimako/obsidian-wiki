# History

Of all the shards [[Azrael]] shed, Glimmer held the most power. It fell in the savannah of [[Elor]] and wrought havoc in the surrounding area, causing the dead to rise and shadows to lengthen. The Enlightened saw only darkness in the future as the armies of the dead rose to march on Elor. They prayed to [[Sura]] to deliver them from this evil and watched as a bright white form descended from the skies above Elor on wings of light and a halo surrounding its head. This champion of Sura had a single eye in the middle of its face which crackled and shone with magical power, its light bearing down on the encroaching armies. Zahriel was an angel burning bright as the times before the War, and it did so knowing it could not be so for long. After it put the dead to rest, Zahriel bore down on Glimmer and surrounded it with arcane light, its body itself dissolving around it. Thus Zahriel became one with Glimmer, forever bound to it and binding its power.

# Glimmer, Legacy of Nightmare

Glimmer itself was found by the Enlightened Council and immediately returned to Elor for safekeeping as a holy artefact of Sura. The knight who found it became the first Nightmare Knight and was able to commune with the angel within, though this shortened his lifespan and ate away at his flesh. Since then, a long line of knights have protected Glimmer in its chamber.

The amalgamation of Zahriel and Glimmer is a unique new creature: an angel of Sura, however diminished, has influence on the arcane while a shard of power from the angel of Death can pierce through the veil and affect souls themselves. Zahriel is the conscious part of Glimmer. The other half of Glimmer that was once Azrael is not conscious - it is simply a vast well of dark energy that seeks to reunite itself with Azrael himself but will latch on to any powerful evil nearby. Glimmer can absorb other shards of Azrael's power, but it may grow to a point where Zahriel alone cannot contain it. A dark consciousness may also emerge within Glimmer.
