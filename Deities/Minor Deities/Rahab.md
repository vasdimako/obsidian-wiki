# Description
Rahab is bound in the depths, held fast by golden chains and a golden collar around his neck. He has long, dark curly hair that floats around him like dead seaweed. Only his chin and mouth is visible - the rest is covered by the dense hair. In his hands is a heavy book, and Rahab lazily writes in it with an inkless pen.

# History
Rahab was born from the blood of Corellon Larethian when he was wounded by Bane's blade. He was one of the primal elves that Corellon so loved, and the god named him Sashelas. He was unpredictable and chaotic, much like the rest of his kin, but he preferred to lurk in the deep places and commune with the creatures of the sea rather than roam the lands freely. When Lolth incited the other primal elves in rebellion, Sashelas did not join her or come to Corellon's defense. He was content to watch the depths, learning from the mortals that perished within. This inaction earned him the ire of Corellon and Sashelas was denied Arvandor's splendor, though he was not removed from the Seldarine outright.

Over time, much of the world sinks to the depths of the oceans and is thought to be lost forever, but it wasn't lost to everyone. Sashelas gleaned much about the world above the waves from that which sinks beneath them: every shipwreck, every offering, and the wealth and knowledge of every seaside city swallowed by a giant wave were added to Sashelas's ever-expanding library of lore. And so it came to be that Sashelas drew the attention of Kelemvor, who required his knowledge to judge the dead.

Kelemvor elevated Sashelas, granting him the power to watch, record and judge all humans from the depths. Leaving behind his carefree chaotic elven nature, Sashelas took on a new name: Rahab. He recorded mortal deeds in his Book of the Dead, Kitab al-Azif, and each individual's page was weighed in Kelemvor's scales to decide a soul's fate. He worked alongside Azrael, who guided souls from the Planes to their afterlife and delivered them safely to their ultimate destination. The two angels of death became close and came to think of each other as brothers. Sashelas lurked in the dark oceans of the Shadowfell, where all lost souls drifted to, and Azrael lived in the Rahab Cathedral built on a grey beach, to be close to his brother. All dead drifted through the Cathedral and on to the afterlife.

During the Sundering, [[Azrael]] grew jealous of his brother, thinking Rahab had been granted more favor and power by the gods while he was a glorified guide. Maybe Shar whispered poisonous words in his ears, fostering his jealousy until it grew into hatred; Rahab never learned the truth. But in secret, Azrael conspired with Shar to bring down his brother as she had once failed to do her sister.

Blessed by Shar's power, Azrael overpowered Rahab and bound him in golden chains Shar's offspring, Mask, stole from Tyr. Rahab was cast down into the depths of the vast sea that lies before the Driftwood Cathedral. Azrael took on the role of recording mortals' names and deeds inÂ Kitab al-Azif, which he stole from his brother.

In the depths, Rahab could not touch or learn of the world except for the fleeting moments a person's entire life flashed before their eyes, right as they crossed the veil. Those he still saw, but no longer judged, simply recorded in his book, the Nameless Tome, working to rebuild the knowledge Azrael had stolen from him.

Since my fall I have waited.

I have watched countless lives flash before countless pairs of eyes.

Every second experienced, I have collected.
