# Personality

Dumah is a lesser god of sleep, serenity and reason. He is often depicted as an old man with bushy white hair, dark skin, slender hands, and a peaceful smile, although it's said that he grows a day younger whenever anybody makes an offering of peace. With a mere glance, he can cause any being to fall into agreeable calmness. The worshippers of Dumah are few and slow to act, preferring to deliberate for a long time before reaching a decision and acting on it. This is why the god is relatively unknown: he is not senior among the gods and chooses clerics or paladins only rarely so there are none to spread word of his worship. His holy symbol is a sheep, sometimes depicted with rainbow-coloured wool.

Dumah, sometimes called Rao, the Calm God, was particularly concerned with keeping the creatures of the Lower Planes out of the Material Plane and preserve the peace. To that end, he created the Crook of Rao, a powerful sacred item to banish such creatures.
