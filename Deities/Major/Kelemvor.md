Kelemvor's avatar appeared much as his mortal self, a human warrior with a dark, tanned face, piercing green eyes, a square-jaw, and a black, wild mane with a grey streaks. He was clad in chainmail and dark leather, and always wore a wide belt with a large, cabochon-cut cat's eye jewel in the front.

# History

Kelemvor was a human, one of the first to be created. He was a mercenary and later paladin who embodied virtue and bravery. Humans rallied around him in the uncertainty of the first war between the creator Sisters. Though Shar was defeated and driven from the world for a time, she left behind death and mortality for the races she and Selune had created. For this reason, Selune sought a worthy individual who already had a seed of her power within them to be elevated and aid the dying mortal races in their journey. Kelemvor was chosen for this and he was elevated to godhood. He later did the same for Azrael and Sashellas.

# Worship

The death clergy, as they were known, had many duties; most involved tending to the last wishes of the dying and providing burial services to those who died alone. They also set out to cure diseases and defend people from monsters so that folk did not die before their time. Their final and arguably most important task was the destruction of undeath in all its various forms as it was an affront to Kelemvor. Elite priests of Kelemvor were known as Doomguides. There also exists an order of paladins dedicated to Kelemvor's service called the Knights of the Eternal Order.

## Church of Kelemvor

It was believed Kelemvor took the essences of the deceased and assigned them to their appropriate places in the eternal cycle of existence. He was the Great Guide, who led everyone into their next life. His clergy proclaimed that this was the case for all souls, regardless of their faith (though that was not true). Kelemvor had his faithful understand that death was part of life, that it was a beginning rather than an end and a necessity rather than a punishment. It was not the ultimate end; instead, it was a step in a continuing and wonderful journey. They viewed death as an orderly process, without deception or chaos. It was not to be rushed, prolonged, or evaded through undeath.

Kelemvorites were bidden to help people to meet their deaths with dignity at their proper time and not before. Unlike followers of some gods of death, they had no intent to wreak devastation and spread death. In word and deed, they opposed those who extended their lifespans beyond what was natural by using necromancy and other magic.

It was the will of Kelemvor that no sentient being, human or otherwise, should die of natural causes without one of his priests to attend them. Nor should they pass on without knowing that Kelemvor would meet them in the afterlife and that he was merciful and just and not to be feared. Thus the clergy believed their highest duty was to seek out folk close to death and aid them.

The church of Kelemvor considered the undead as an abomination and sought their destruction whenever possible. They also sought out and destroyed anyone who extended their lives well beyond the natural limit, such as liches.

## Doomguides

Doomguides maintained discipline in the clergy. They also oversaw fund-raising to raise funds for the church. Beyond this, doomguides were tasked with the eradication of necromantic practices, along with anyone who propagated the existence of the undead. To this end they often traveled with adventuring companies, aiding them when presented with the threat of the undead. While important, their roles as undead hunters was entirely secondary.

Doomguides served Kelemvor in a manner different that the clergy's other priests, acting as couriers between his temples and bringing aid to everyone across the lands. They were expected to travel far and wide, to spread Kelemvor's teachings regarding the afterlife share with mortals what they will face after death.

## Mortarchs and Necrobanes

Mortarchs were priests whose specialization lied in the arts of funerals. Their main duties were to consecrate graves, maintain and pass on knowledge regarding burial customs, and to provide comfort the grieving family members of the deceased.

The duty of a necrobane was to seek out and destroy any undead creature. They halted the spread and destroyed animated corpses such as skeletons and zombies. They also sought out undead souls, such as ghouls and wights, so that they may be put to rest.

## wORSHIP

Most rituals of the church of Kelemvor were private and personal, performed with individuals who were passing into the next life. The Passing was a simple ceremony of last rites. The cleric chanted comforting words and it acted as a signal to Kelemvor to remain on alert for the essence of the passing individual.

A larger ceremony, the Lament for the Fallen, was sung over a field of battle, a recently destroyed location or any site where many individuals were killed recently.

Every morning, the clerics performed the Remembrance. It was a dignified ritual performed in cemeteries and was usually attended by the relatives of the deceased and was comprised of prayers and songs.

In the evening, the clerics performed the Daeum, also know as Thanks to the Guide. It was a ritual celebrating the courage, purpose and strength of Kelemvor and the goals of his church. It was attended only by members of the church. At the end of this ceremony, the possessions of the dead were distributed to the clergy. Additionally, favors from Kelemvor and holy missions were dispensed by the senior clergy.

The two most holy days for the church of Kelemvor were Feast of the Moon and Shieldmeet. On both these high holy days, clerics of Kelemvor performed Deeds of the Dead, which extolled the greatness and importance of the ancestors to those still living so they were never forgotten. On both these days, clerics could cast speak with dead for as long as required, so long conversations with the dead could be held.
