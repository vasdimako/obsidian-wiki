Talos appeared as a broad-shouldered, bearded man with one good eye. He wore half-plate armor over black leather and black leather gloves. His empty eye socket was filled with whirling stars and covered with a dark eye patch.

Talos was violent, angry, short-tempered, impulsive, and frequently motivated by his fury. He could be roused to raging destruction by the smallest offences and hold onto a grudge for centuries after the slight. His actions often seemed petty and vengeful, and indeed they were. He reveled in chaos and exulted in unrestrained devastation, causing ruin for the pure joy of it.

# Worship

The clergy of Talos were referred to as Talassans. Most Talassans were specialty priests called stormlords, each of whom led their own cell of followers and agents. Some of the titles associated with the clergy included, in ascending rank, Storm Supplicant, Weatherwise, Talon, Lord/Lady of Fury, Eye of the Storm, Reaver, Stormherald, High Stormherald, and Weathermaster or Weathermistress. The final three titles were always confirmed by Talos himself.

Talassan initiates were struck by red lightning emitted by a pair of small storm clouds. The lightning was harmless, but represented Talos' acceptance of them into his following. This process was referred to as being "touch by Talos.
