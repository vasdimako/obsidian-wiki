Shar was described as a tall, beautiful humanoid with dark black hair. When visiting mortals in dreams, her dark hair would move and swirl regardless of gravity or outside forces, such as wind.

The very existence of Shar was paradoxical; the Nightbringer was brought into existence by the creation of Realmspace, but was the living embodiment of the void, the perfect nothing that existed before she was born. The emptiness that she originally reflected had itself been erased at the start of time, and she longed to return to the ancient calm of nonexistence.

The depths of Shar's evil were too extreme to be described by words. She was deeply twisted and perverse, a being of ceaseless, petty hate and envy. She plotted from the shadows to undermine all creation, reveling in the hidden and never to be revealed. Though she was not chaotic herself, like her sister was, Shar nonetheless sought to destroy all order.

After being forced to co-exist with the other gods, Shar was initially enraged but eventually accepted her fate. Her aspect of darkness was diminished, and she focused on her portfolio of loss and fate. She focused on healing the grief and pain of death for those left behind.
