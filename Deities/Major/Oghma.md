Oghma was known to appear as a handsome, dark-skinned man in bright, resplendent, and stylish clothes. Typically his outfit included a tabard with projecting, ornamented shoulder plates, a cummerbund with an exquisitely beautiful scene painted on its medallion-shaped buckle, and open meshwork, point-toed boots with crystal teardrops dangling from the end of uppers, almost enough to touch the upraised toes.

On very rare occasions, Oghma appeared as a gigantic elderly man entirely cloaked by his long, flowing hair and beard, who flew through the air hurling spells.

Oghma was legendary for his geniality and possessed of both great wisdom and profound powers of persuasion; he used his good looks, peerless charm, and rhetorical prowess to sway even his most ardent opposition to his cause. However, while outwardly cheery and often quietly humorous and quick to smile, the Binder could also be solemn and righteous.

# Worship

The common clergy within the Church of Oghma were referred to as loremasters. Acolytes were called seekers and senior seekers. A seeker would be recognized as a true servant of Oghma when two priests discerned their true loyalty to the god. Titles for venerated members of the clergy included Loremaster Amanuensis, Loremaster Venturer, Loremaster Bold, Lore Scribe of the God, Wise Anticipator, Inspirator, Inspirator High, Atlar, Higher Atlar, Loremaster High, Loremaster Most High, Eye of Oghma, and Divine Hand of Oghma. Titles specific to the Pursuers of Pure Knowledge in Mintar and Oghma's faithful in Sembia included, in ascending order, Advocate, Accomplished Advocate, Loremaster of the Twelfth, Loremaster of the Eleventh, etc., Loremaster High, Learned One, and Patriarch. Regardless of rank, followers of Oghma addressed each other as brother and sister.

Knowledge was supreme, especially in its purest formâ€“the idea. Though weightless, a simple idea could move mountains and cast aside empires. Knowledge was power, but must be used responsibly. Hiding knowledge was never a good thing. The voices of singers and bards was to be appreciated and always listened to. A follower of Oghma would not stand idly by while a singer or bard was attacked.
