Lliira initially manifested as brightly whirling lights and smoke in the middle of the air before a young woman danced out from the cloud. This 9 feet (2.7 meters) lady was sensuous and shapely, laughing and dancing through the air without concern for dignity or pride. She had eyes of pure blue, long, golden hair (sometimes streaked with silver or odd pastels of blue, pink, green, or lilac), and wore a tight-fitting body suit under a series of thin, translucent robes which artfully twirled and draped as she moved. A sparkling wake of winking lights trailed behind her as she danced, flashing at least 60 feet (18 meters) behind her and longer if she so desired.

Few things were sufficient to bring down Lliira's joyful revelry as she went about enjoying life without a care in the world, remaining somewhat detached from everyday events. She had a flair for performance, but was neither ambitious nor greedy, willing to resist temptation and abstain from power out of loyalty and respect for promises made.

Lliira could not, however, tolerate violence or ill feelings, especially at celebrations, and was known to withhold her blessing from revels marred by it. A sword drawn in anything but ceremony was enough to drive her away, and she would simply leave if combat broke out. She herself refused to do harm to others unless absolutely necessary, though she did not consider certain methods of dealing with problematic people to be hurting them. She was willing to temporarily transform or transport others somewhere else, and likewise would personally pull pranks (such as replacing wine with sour milk) either as a joke or to get back at those who insulted her.

# Worship

Priests of Lliira are known as Joybringers and Joydancers. Her clergy were renowned throughout Illira for their easy going and good-hearted nature, making them some of the most popular clerics in the continent.

## Orders
**Order of the Scarlet Mummers:** One of the church's first knightly orders, the Mummers were formed to avenge the murder of Lliira's High Revelmistress in Holbreck. Their duties included protecting Lliiran temples and battling with Loviatans. Their battle prowess caused their fellows in the church to both fear and respect them.

## Worship

Lliira's Night: A festival holiday held annually on 7th of Flamerule that honored the eponymous goddess. It began in the city of Baldur's Gate, but by the late 15th century the celebration had spread all across the Sword Coast.
