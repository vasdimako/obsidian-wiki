# History

Azrael was the shepherd and ferryman of the dead, bringing them to the Grey City. Kelemvor weighed each soul, judging their worthiness and rightful afterlife. He offered a bite of his apple to those whose time had come, to sweeten their passing. 

>Let this apple take your body from you
>Let my hand guide you to your rightful place
>For I am your shepherd

Things changed when Rahab arrived. The Watcher became Azrael's companion and took over judgement of the dead. The two worked together as brothers and were glad for the companionship and joint purpose. In time, as the gods' creations multiplied, Azrael sent out ferrymen to sail on the River Lethe and retrieve the souls of the dead. Those that needed the respite of the river's waters received it promptly.

But as the Sundering approached, Azrael began to feel envy towards his brother. Why had Kelemvor entrusted such a vital task to Rahab, while leaving him to be a mere shepherd? These thoughts came to him, unbidden or sent by some malicious source, and they would not quiet. Azrael conspired with Shar, his creator, to usurp Rahab's power for himself in exchange for joining her. 

After Rahab was imprisoned and the dust of the Sundering had settled, Azrael took on the role of both shepherd and watcher in the new divine order. His betrayal was but a footnote, known only to Shar herself.

> I have watched you since you were born
> I wrote your name in my book as you came into this world
> I have had an eye watching your entire life
> See now, your name fades with time
> And now you shall return from whence you came
> Delivered from this mortal coil
