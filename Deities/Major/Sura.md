# History

Sura was born of conflict and thrust into conflict in his first moment of existence. The gods and universe were formless ideas then, and Sura was a chaotic combination of symmetrically opposed forces. Even the most learned scholars cannot say how the newly born god chose, but choose he did, siding with Selune to banish her sister Shar.

Many deities were born of the sisters' conflict, each representing a part of them. These deities felt secure in their purpose and domains, drawn to aspects of the universe naturally. Born of contradiction, Sura's direction was far less clear. It is said he spent untold time among the stars, seeking answers. His power was unparalleled, being the only god that combined parts of both sisters. He had control over magic rivalling deities of the Arcana domain, and either this control or some other aspect of his power allowed him to see all things in the universe at all moments of their existence. This both solidified his divinity and shattered his sense of self - chaotic power without will to direct it.

Sura returned during [[The Sundering]] - there are accounts of a humanoid form clad in shimmering robes appearing at various places in the world, though their accuracy is dubious. His face was split in half - the right side white, the left black, galaxies swirling in his three eyes. He was part of the group responsible for preparing and conducting the ritual that irreversibly bound both Shar and Selune and [[Major Deities]], and aided in the construction of the Divine Gate.

# Personality

Sura very rarely appears to worshippers directly or interferes with the world. Only in particularly dire times has he taken an active role in historical events. Worshippers theorize the god may be distracted or unable to maintain his attention on one particular subject or event for long because of his vast sight and power.

# Worship

Sura has many eponyms - the All-Seeing, the Three-Eyed God, the Starwanderer. Some of his worshippers believe that no mortal has ever been granted Sura's favour, while others think each and every magician and oracle ever born were his unknowing acolytes. Regardless of the truth, the fact is that Sura does not grant clerical powers in the traditional way and sends no signs or visions of his will to his followers. No prophets have ever been confirmed to speak on his behalf or perform miracles in his name, no holy texts have been passed down the ages.

There is also a distinct lack of instruction by the god on how he should be worshipped - no preference has ever been shown to a specific sect over another on account of differences in their practices. Because of that, those who wished to honour the Three-Eyed God traditionally chose whichever way seemed appropriate. Even his holy symbol is variable, though it always contains some number of open eyes. Out of the countless ways Sura has been worshipped throughout history, three are worthy of mention for amassing significant amounts of followers:

* **The Starseekers**: these followers of Sura usually maintain shrines in wild, far-off mountaintops with an unobstructed view of the sky and darkness for miles around. They believe the truth of the universe can be read in the stars if one can learn their mystical language. Their work is similar to the usual astronomer's, but they seek signs of the future in the movement of the stars as well as document the night sky.
* **The All-Keepers**: this sect believe that all magic is part of the All-Seeing and so consider all scrolls and magical tomes to be holy texts to Sura. They have dedicated themselves to the collection, cataloguing and safekeeping of such texts, as well as the study of the Weave itself. Rumours say their spellcasting is different to traditional wizardry and more similar to the high magic the elves once practiced. With the amount of ancient knowledge in their remote monasteries, such a thing is certainly possible.
* **Suraism, Sura's Faithful**: this group of worshippers consider their teachings to be the predominant way of worshipping the All-Seeing. Their practices most resemble a traditional religion out of all types of Sura worship, and they are the most numerous. Their principal temple is the Serene Spiral, and their religious leaders are the Enlightened, who also double as the heads of state for Elor. Sura is often depicted as a seven-armed humanoid with three eyes on its face and an eye on each of its palms by this church.

Because of the distinct lack of contact between Sura and his petitioners, his worship is not widespread in the wider world. His temples are usually in remote places and have little contact with the nearby nations, making little effort to proselytize new believers. The one exception to this is Elor, the centre of Suraism: every single child is raised with the story of how one of Sura's champion descended from the heavens, clad in arcane light, to protect the city from an army of undead and left behind Glimmer, his weapon, so that Elor would always be protected. No one knows why Sura went to such lengths to protect Elor, but they feel immense pride in their status as the Three-Eyed God's favoured city.
