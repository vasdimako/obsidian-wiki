Auril typically appeared as an attractive human woman with blue skin. Her body was made from ice and snow.

When angered, she appears in a different form, called the Cold Crone, a hunched bipedal creature standing 7 feet (2.1 meters) tall and with snowy owl's head with a pair of curled ram's horns, cloven hooves, and arms that end in sharp talons. 

Auril was the embodiment of winter's wrath. She was arrogant, capricious and unpredictable. She took great pleasure in torturing her enemies and harassing her foes. Sacrifices and worship to her was often done out of fear.

# Worship

In the North, Auril was a commonly worshiped, and feared, goddess and an integral part of northern cultures. Northlanders considered Auril one of their primary deities and was a key part of their culture. She was feared and seen as the harbinger of winter upon the whole world. In the late autumn and over the winter, regular sacrifices were made to her. Sacrifices of food were place upon rafts which were then set adrift in the ocean. 

Auril was one of the deities worshiped by air and water genasi, especially those who lived in cold regions. Air gensasi tended to be zealous in their worship, with a fanatical devotion to Auril.

## Holy Days

* Midwinter (Night), Hammer 30 to Alturiak 1. This was the most holy night of the year for the clergy, a festival of ice-dancing that lasted all night. Druids were also known to pay respect to the Frostmaiden on this date.
- The Coming Storm and the Last Storm, informal but enthusiastically celebrated rituals where the priests gathered and called howling ice storms down on a region to mark the onset and end of winter.
- Auril's Blesstide, or Auril's Day, was a holiday (of sorts) held annually in the city of Waterdeep on the first day of new frost in the year. It was not so much a holiday as a way to seek to appease the Frostmaiden in hopes of a mild winter.
