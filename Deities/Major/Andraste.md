Andraste was a human woman, tall in stature and blonde of hair.

> And thus fell the eye of [[the Maker]] upon Andraste, she who would be raised up from outcast to become His bride. From her lips would fall the Chant of Light, at her command would the legions of righteousness fall upon the world.

# History

Andraste was a human woman born in the harsh environment of Rhaan to the nomadic Alamarri tribe that lived there. According to Chantry scholars, Andraste's mother was Ciriane and her father was Elderath. Andraste's sister Halliserre died in a violent incident under mysterious circumstances with Andraste present.

This is said to have scarred Andraste in many ways: she was left with a lung sickness and strange behavior, such as entering trance-like states and reporting sensing voices and strange auras afterwards. Later on, Andraste came to consider this incident a matter of heresy, convinced her mother and sister were communing with Old Gods.

Andraste was married to Maferath to unify the tribes of Rhaan. The two had children, both by Andraste and a concubine, but their fates are unknown. At some point, Andraste was taken slave by the Tevinter Imperium during the same raid that caused her father's death. The Alamarri rallied around Andraste, demanding her release, and refused to follow Maferath until she was returned.

Andraste began to see herself as a conduit to the truth of the Maker around this point. It is said by the Chantry that her visions returned during her hardship, culminating to a conversation with the Maker himself. When she was released, Andraste called the Exalted March against the Imperium, who still believed in the Profane Gods. She also joined forces with the astral elves of Krynn and together crushed the Imperium in the battle of Aryth, which left the moon completely destroyed.

But Andraste was betrayed by her husband Maferath, who grew jealous of the people's adoration for her. He conspired with the remaining forces of Tevinter and allowed them to kidnap Andraste, bring her back to Barrakas and burn her at the stake. This act sealed Tevinter's fate as Andraste's forces fought fiercly to wipe them out completely. It was as if Tevinter was cursed by a divine force by slaying the Maker's bride, and they could win no battles against the Andrastians.

In the final days of the Imperium, ten years after Andraste's death, Archon Hessarian, last of the magister leaders of Tevinter, revealed Maferath's betrayal and proclaimed Tevinter an Andrastean nation. Maferath was slain when this became known, and the remnants of Tevinter allowed to survive. 

# Worship

The worship of Andraste is primarily facilitated by [[the Chantry]]. It is said her ashes lie at the Temple of Sacred Ashes at a secret location in Wildspace, protected by a group of people named the Disciples of Andraste.
