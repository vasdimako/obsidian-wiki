# History

Helm was born from Selune's tears of rage as she watched the beautiful universe darken under Shar's assaults. He inherited Selune's deep love for the universe as responsibility - he would protect this beautiful world from all that might seek to corrupt or harm it. Helm always wore a heavy, full suit of armor representing the weight of this responsibility. He was the Watcher, the Eternal Sentry, and always fulfilled his duties without complaint.

The violence and chaos brought about by the Profane gods enraged Helm, and he was among the strongest proponents of continued war and complete destruction of the attacking pantheon. And so he fought until the final moment, and when the [[The Sundering#The Denouncement|Denouncement]] took hold and his mind cleared, Helm saw the destruction the conflict had wrought on the world. Helm shed a single tear that fell to Atus, but stopped before hitting ground. Hovering over the crater of destruction left below, the teardrop appeared as a magnificent gemstone, filled with the torment and guilt that Helm felt inside. It is said that the gemstone known as kings' tears - mined in various places across Illira, is a lesser version of this legendary gem.

After the Sundering and [[The Sundering#The Denouncement|Denouncement]], Helm was the main proponent of erecting a Gate that would prevent the gods from ever directly touching the Inner Planes. Because it would affect all gods equally, the sixteen eventually reached an agreement and joined their powers to construct this Divine Gate. Helm and his Watchers volunteered to stand vigil, ensuring nothing from the divine planes would cross over. The Profane tasked a very reluctant Bane to do the same, and they have both stood guard over each other as well as the Gate ever since.

Helm has a strong sense of justice and responsibility, ever vigilant for those that might threaten the world no matter their alignment. He is swift to punish those he deems worthy of it, but has a soft spot for children.


# The Vigilant Eyes

Helmites are few and far between, for the god only blesses individuals with a sense of justice and responsibility comparable to his own. They are generally respected for their dedication and purpose and unfailingly come to the aid of those who call for it in times of crisis. Though they are generally clerics and paladins who have dedicated their life to his worship, other extraordinary individuals might find Helm's eye is on them after a particularly appropriate act.

Helmites do not organise as such - his clerics work locally with religious and civilian government (see Anvar) and his paladins generally travel alone. There is, however, a group of Knights of Helm called the Vigilant Eyes. These individuals can be recognized by the holy symbol of Helm they bear on their gauntlets. They generally wear polished silver armour and plumed helmets and are welcomed everywhere as bearers of Light and bringers of good news.

The oldest and most powerful knight in the order is called the Supreme Watcher. This individual has no authority over the other Knights except in times when Helm orders the Vigilant Eyes to gather as one to face a greater threat. In that case, the Supreme Watcher would serve as their spiritual leader and commander in battle. To this day, this call from Helm has never come but the Vigilant Eyes maintain their duties and traditions diligently. This dedication to unseen responsibilities and greater powers can be extremely difficult to maintain, which is why the Vigilant Eyes are few. Helm demands the same qualities he displays from his followers.

# Worship

One of the holiest of the Helmite rituals was the consecration of a Postulant, performed upon the confirmation of a person's dedication as they entered into the ranks of the Helmite clergy. Others included the consecration of a Glymtul, was used to dedicate items into service unto Helm; the purification, a ritual of atonement when clergy returned to the faith after leaving its service, or otherwise failed in their duties; and the Holy Vigil, a night-long ceremony was performed by a priest of Helm when they ascended in rank within the church.

The faithful of Helm otherwise held very few other annual observances or holidays.
