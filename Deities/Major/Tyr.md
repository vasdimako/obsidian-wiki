Tyr had many titles among mortals; among them was the Even-Handed, Grimjaws, the Maimed God, Wounded Tyr, Blind Tyr, the Blind Overlord, the Wounded One, and the Just God. These titles symbolized his nature to his followers. Among the Outer Planes, he was known as the One-Handed.

Tyr was portrayed as blind or with a bloody bandage over his eyes and missing his right hand, for which he bore his title of the Maimed God. (His title of the Even-Handed, though it referred to his position of god of justice, was also seen as dark humor.) His wounded eyes were seen as symbolic of "blind justice" and the sometimes cost of living a lawful life.

He usually was shown as a burly, noble warrior, with a powerful build and a bearded face.

When an avatar of Tyr appeared to his followers, his eyes (or eye) were at first the color of bright steel, but they faded away to empty sockets before the avatar vanished. His brow always shone with a white radiance or halo, leaving no doubt as to his divine nature.

He was often shown wielding a powerful magic sword or warhammer and dressed in light armor or chainmail. He did not try to hide or bandage his stump.

Tyr was strong-spirited and noble. He was considered the bravest and the most honorable of all the Aesir of the Norse pantheon. He was primarily concerned with the punishment of wrong-doers and the general furthering of law and good in the world. Tyr hated duplicity, trickery, rule-breaking, and wanton destruction. He likewise hated lies and the breaking of oaths and was disgusted by persons who earned from such things. For his own part, he never would break a promise.

Tyr was a fair judge, but he was hard to understand to those outside his faith, as they more readily perceived him as a stern and rigid punisher. On the other hand, he was seen as a brave father-figure to his followers. In truth, he was well aware that a lawful utopia would never be possible in the imperfect Material Plane, yet this did not stop him from trying to make the world a better place for his mortal followers. He wanted his followers to see themselves as a "perfect family", not made of perfect individuals but rather of members who tried and wanted to be perfect, who acted out of trust, courage, and love toward each other. His knowledge that such a dream would never be achieved among the mortal realm filled him with genuine sadness.

# Worship

The Tyrrans saw the world in black-and-white morality and wanted Illira to be cleansed of its lawlessness and chaos. They were devoted to justice and the deliverance of vengeance, but not in the manner that sought equality. Rather, they believed in illuminating the truth behind corruption and punishment of the guilty.

Intolerance and humorlessness was a common trait found among the faithful within the church of Tyr. This stark perspective extended into their outlook on life in the Realms, that the contrast between right and wrong was evident, and the justice they delivered was no laughing matter.

The clergy of Tyr would uphold the law wherever they traveled, taking thorough accounts of their judgments, rulings and actions. Through these accounts they corrected their errors and honed their understanding of the various laws of the lands throughout Faer√ªn. Their actions should always abide by the law and let none others break them. They were to be vigilant in their watch, swift to intercede and never fail to bring justice upon lawbreakers.

Within the more civilized areas of Illira, Tyrrans served as legal experts and lawyers. They would dispense legal advice and often advocate for those accused of guilt in trials. Although they would often lecture others who failed to completely adhere to a law and complained about extraneous formalities. However, they would often address these complaints to local authorities to ensure they would be better followed in the future. However these actions occurred, the faithful of Tyr would never enforce an edict that was shown to be unjust or contradicted another law.

Within the wilderness, where law was seldom a concern, the Tyrran priests served as judge, jury and executioner. While they often equated vengeance for justice in their actions, they adhered to the philosophy of demonstrating "the mercy of ignorance." If someone was truly unknowing of local laws and customs, they were allowed a warning, albeit recorded for posterity in case of future transgressions.

## Titles
As highly organized and regimented the hierarchy was within the church of Tyr, there were quite a number of ranks and titles available to his faithful. In descending order these were:

- Keeper of the Balance
- Defender of Justice
- Hammer Lord
- Knight Commander
- High Avenger
- High Lord Abbot
- Abbot
- Master Avenger
- Avenger
- Just Captain
- Vigilant Watcher
- Hammer of Tyr
- Sword of Tyr
- Lawkeeper
- Solemn brother/sister
- Acolyte of Laws

## Knightly Orders

- Knights of Holy Judgment: This order attracted those who emphasized the "lawful" aspect of Tyr's faith. They specifically hunted devils, whom they viewed as perversions of true "lawfulness".
- Knights of the Merciful Sword: These knights stressed the "good" facet of his teachings.

## Rituals

Within their temples and abbeys, the clergy of Tyr included sung invocations, recited responsive prayers led by the head priest, gave sermons, teachings and readings from the holy texts of the Sacred Judgements of Tyr, and recited an anthem to close their ceremony. These were held every two hours, and each was representative of an aspect of Tyr.

The ritual held at dawn, the Awakening was gentle and uplifting in nature. Later on at noon, the Hammer at Highsun was a stirring oration on their vigilance and martial prowess. High Justice, held at evenfeast was a stern and proud commemoration on Tyr's laws and commandments. Finally, at dusk, the Remembrance of the Just Fallen was a haunting, softly-chanted hymn that revered those who died for the cause of justice, regardless of whether or not they followed Tyr's dogma. It was known to bring many bystander to tears.

The church of Tyr followed a monthly routine of rituals. Seeing Justice occurred on the first day, the Maiming on the 13th and the Blinding on the 22nd day of each month. All of these major observances involved chanted prayers, hymns and conjured displays of the god's holy symbol.
