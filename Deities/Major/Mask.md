Avatars of Mask within his temples usually appeared as slightly built human males wearing soft gray leather armor, a black cloak, and a black mask tinged with red (believed by scholars to be his true or chosen form). He might also manifest as a soft-spoken human female with pale, glowing skin, dark, floor-length hair, and starry white lights for eyes. This form always walked barefoot and was constantly shrouded in a shadow-like gloom. In public however, Mask's form was entirely inconsistent, appearing as members of all races, genders, ages, builds, and capabilities. No matter his form however, his movements made no sound and left no trail.

Known for his constant scheming, cool head, and oft-reserved biting comment.

# Worship

The Clergy of Mask were called Maskarrans, with elite specialty priests referred to as demarchesses (pronounced: /dɛmɑːrˈkɛsɛs/ deh-mar-KESS-es) if female, and demarchs (pronounced: /dɛˈmɑːrks/ deh-MARKS) if male. Maskarrans addressed each other as "Brother/Sister Shadow", no matter their rank. Clergy that completed an especially dangerous heist or complex act of manipulation were often admitted to the Circle of the Gray Ribbon.

It was rumored that the Cult of Mask maintained a large network of informants throughout the cities of the realm. It was also rumored that this network provided employment for all sorts of thieves, beggars and thugs.

Mask's faithful were led to believe that the god saw everything that happens in the dark and to trust it, as one would be made an easy target by walking into plain light. The abilities to deceive, as truth was a foolish virtue and manipulation was better than brute force, and to be dextrous were also appreciated. Whilst the faith advocated for accumulating riches, it also said to only steal what was necessary. They also believed that owning something simply required being in possession of it.
