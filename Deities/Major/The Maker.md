The Maker (also referred to as "The Maker of the World" and "The Wellspring of All") is the deity worshipped by [[the Chantry]]. He is referred to as a male, and the prophetess [[Andraste]], who inspired the foundation of the Chantry, is considered to be His wife. While the Chantry believes that the Maker is all-powerful and created all things, they also believe that He has turned away from them. The Chantry believes this to be because of the faults of His creations. He will not answer prayers, grant wishes or do anything of the sort until humanity proves itself worthy of His attention again. As such, Andrastian religion in Krynn can be described as deistic in that the creator deity does not communicate with the created world.
