Silvanus had both an old and young avatar form that he was known to manifest in.

His old form was known as the Old Father. It took the form of an old, bearded human male face, either floating midair among trees or sprouting from the trunk of an especially large and old tree. The flesh of this form was always brown, gray, and fissured like old wood.

His young form was known as the Young Strider. This was a young, long-limbed humanoid male, with particularly long legs, dressed in a suit of armor made of leaves and wielding a wooden mallet. He most often assumed this form when a sacred grove was threatened or a circle of druids was attacked during their worship.

Another form he was known to manifest as was the Horned Hunter, an entity similar in appearance to his fellow Celtic god Cerunnos. This form was an always silent man with burning white eyes, sporting a set of stag antlers and shaggy brown fur that was almost bark-like. This form always appeared among the trees, often just to indicate something by a gesturing, nodding, or pointing before disappearing.

Typical of nature deities, some described Silvanus as being wild and unpredictable, much like nature itself.

He was chiefly concerned with nature itself, specifically wild nature, in both its natural beauty and fierce savagery. Caring very little for maintaining a proper balance with civilization, being wrathful towards those who threaten wild places. He paid no attention to the machinations of mortals or other deities.

When it came to nature itself, he cared greatly for maintaining a balance between growth and decay, water and drought, fire and ice â€” the natural cycle of life. This was considered to be his dogma and he was emotionally distant in regards to its necessity. This led some to view him as heartless, though in reality he valued all life.

He had a special hatred for those who used fire carelessly or with deliberate intention to cause destruction.

# Worship

Silvanus had both clerics and druids in his faith, though their presence varied by location, with druids being the more prominent due to his narrow focus on wild nature without concern for balance.
