He was portrayed as a man with a crystalline face, clear to all who saw him. His statements were clear, concise, and rarely what the listener wished to hear. Savras' symbol was a crystal ball with many monstrous eyes.

# Worship

Savras was worshiped in both the north and south as both a god of diviners and truth-speakers. In Elor, worship of Savras has recently increased, with some believing him to be an aspect of Sura.

The most devout worshipers of Savras carried around elaborate staves with them at all times. This was in the hope that their god might make their staff his temporary residence.

Recently, an order in service of Savras has formed all across Illira. Consisting mainly of archivists (and incidentally containing the highest concentration of archivists of any group in the Realms) the **Benign Order of the Third Eye**'s members were all granted a vision from Savras where he impressed upon them the need to collect magic and lore in preparation for an upcoming unknown battle.
