# History
Af was an angel that embodied anger in service to the gods. He was a fierce fighter who brought vengeance down upon those who deserved it. During the war, he found the anger of Shar towards her sister was impossible to ignore and gravitated towards the side of the Primordial gods.

During the Xathi invasion, Af was directed to destroy the strange beings. To that end, he teamed up with Simikiel, an angel of the Moon. The pair fought off legions of Xathi and emerged victorious, but then Simikiel ran his greatsword, Moonkeeper, through Af from behind.

Gravely injured, Af collapsed and bled, left for dead. His anger at Simikiel sustained him and he lived for countless years while the dust of the war settled, trapped in place by the Moonkeeper. A tribe of nomads found him in what would become known as the Kaanthi plains, hearing his screams from afar. They drank of his blood and became the Kaanthi, changed forever from the celestial's essence.

# Personality
Af was rage incarnate. That's not to say he was always out of control, but those who incurred his anger were methodically destroyed in time. His anger sharpened his blade and strengthened his muscles, and he was one of the gods' greatest instruments.

In the beginning of his eternity of enduring Moonkeeper's burning blade, Af raged endlessly against it and promised vengeance against the betrayer Simikiel. But the angel of anger was not blind to when anger became a blinding, useless thing. When the Kaanthi found him, Af's angellic essence poured out of his wound as blood and gave life to a pitiful people. As the Kaanthi drank his blood, Af found his anger draining away and being replaced by protectiveness for his people. But his agony was evident to them, and the Kaanthi decided they would help him. Now, the pain was manageable in all but the brightest nights, when Moonkeeper absorbed the most moonlight.

In this way, Af was forced to find relief not through anger and vengeance but through service and redemption. It saddens the angel that the Kaanthi feel compelled to free him by any means, as he would once have been to exact vengeance, but it also lessens his pain to be so loved.
