# History

Without a homeland, the Vistani roam the [[Shadowfell]], practicing their inscrutable ways. Vistani clans contain folk of many differing races. They rove outside the politics and concerns of civilization. Their magic and guile allow them to safely traverse the dark gulfs between settled areas and to cross the barriers between worlds. To sedentary people, these numinous vagabonds bring exotic goods, news, services, and skills. They take away new friends, orphaned children, survival essentials, any sometimes more than they honestly earned. Natural rovers and fortune-tellers, the Vistani are known for their skill at traveling to, from, and within the Shadow fell. The Vistani of the Shadowfell are unpredictable. They favor the dark, unforgiving world of the Shadow fell because of the moral ambiguity of its inhabitants and because it makes their own celebrations feel brighter and more lively.

In spite of isolationist tendencies, there remain enumerable observable similarities in Vistani lifestyles which bind all the tasques together as a single people. They all own the name "Vistani," of course, a word in their patterna that translates as "human" or "thinking creature." They also share an ability to enter the Mists and other Domains and travel through them. All Vistani practice fortunetelling to some extent, and all of them can invoke the evil eye. And, of course, all Vistani are possessed of the dread power to curse in the most terrible ways.

# Organisation

All Vistani are led by both a patriarch and a matriarch figure, the captain and the raunie. Each has his or her respective duties and spheres of authority. Captain and raunie may be husband and wife or brother and sister, or even cousins, but they always share the family name. All caravan members are related to them, be they parents, offspring, siblings, cousins, or spouses. The captain is the caravan master, responsible for maintaining the equipment, vardos, and animals. He supervises each setup and breakdown of camp, chooses the site and when to leave it (if not forced to move on), and delegates responsibilities for gathering wood, water, and food. When commerce arises with giorgios, some captains openly take charge and some remain aloof, but all important business decisions are the captain's alone. The raunie holds the highest authority in a Vistani tribe, however. When there are matters concerning the entire tribe, she is the one who presides over any discussion, and her decision is binding. The raunie sits in judgment of conflicts between members. Hers is the right to pronounce, and even inflict, punishment upon transgressors. She is most often the treasurer of her people as well.

The Vistani mostly forage for herbs and other plants as they travel, as they are unable to farm. Their herblore is unparalleled. They cook exclusively over an open fire, soups, stews, and other kettle dishes make up the bulk of their repast, but Vistani also like to skewer bits of meat upon sharpened sticks and roast them in the flames. They mostly drink water, remaining lucid at all times, though they sometimes serve drinks to giorgios. They only drink alcohol during special occasions.

<p>Vistan was not our king, nor was he our enemy. His cause was not ours, nor were his spoils of war, yet his defeat was thrust upon us. In the land called Transyl, the conqueror was crushed by warriors of a nameless god, and all his legions were made slaves.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We were not, ourselves, brought into bondage, for Vistan was not our king, but neither were we allowed to return to the home forge, for the Transylites decreed that none should return with word of what had befallen Vistan and his armies. “Vistani” they named us, and made us beggars, and promised they would murder us if our vardos ever faced east.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then Kaldresh rose among us and spoke of a vision which taught him that the world was round, and he promised we should find the home forge if we continued moving always west.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Vistan was not our king, nor was he our enemy, yet forever we bear his name and his fate, for the world is truly flat, and we shall never see our homeland again.</p></th>

# Rituals

Almost every aspect of Vistani culture is steeped in ritual, from the way they sprinkle herbs into their cookpots in a triangular motion (the path of nourishment, from the ground, to the plant, to the body, to the ground) to the prastonata and the doroq. It sustains the culture of a tribe when various caravans go their separate ways, binding them together even though they are apart for months or years.

**Setting camp** makes for a ritual universal among different tribes. Sometimes the proper place settle for the night is carefully scouted, and sometimes it is spontaneously chosen, but in either case the male leader of the caravan (called the captain) paces out the dimensions of the site, then finds its center and declares, "Kir-yahg, " which loosely translates from the patterna as "make fire," aithough the command is strictly metaphorical. If possible he does not move from his position until all vardos (wagons), animals, and tribesmen have proceeded to points designated with a gesture of his first two fingers. When the caravan has come to rest, the female leader (called the raunie) joins the captain at the center of camp and confirms his choice. There are rare cases where a raunie objects to a site, usually for mystical reasons, in which case the tribe must move on. Barring this happenstance, the raunie cries, "Kir-yahg, " and the setting of camp proceeds. When the time comes to depart the area and the caravan is packed up, the captain inspects the camp to be sure it has been properly cleared of all refuse and other objects, then places his hand into the cold ashes of the fire pit, proving to the raunie that it has been completely extinguished. He moves to the center of camp, declares, "Dya-yahg" ("leave the fire"), and then leads the caravan away.

One of the most vivid images a giorgio may have of a Vistani encampment is the ritual dancing around the fire, the **prastonata**. This ritual precedes the doroq, the telling of stories and legends. Indeed, the dance tells a story of its own, not with gestures that represent words or ideas, but with movement and expressions that confer complex emotions. If times are good for the caravan, the dancer, known as the prastona, moves wildly and freely, while stressful events engender anguished gestures and mournful times yield sluggish, tortured steps. The dance drives the accompanying music, not the other way around. In her art, the prastona effectively embodies the feelings of the entire group, reinforcing their community, and dramatizing both poverty and prosperity in lithe beauty.

Once the prastonata has concluded, the musicians retire and the time for telling legends arrives. They have many tales to tell, stories of love, heroism, tragedy, time, and countless other subjects. The Vistani tell them with a flair that would put a Kartakan bard to shame. Often, since my visits with the Vistani, have I sat by my own little fire at home and regaled a guest with the **doroq**.

The three days the moon is in full phase are called **Fulltide**. During this time the Vistani seek to bring all matters in their lives to fruition. When a Vistana makes a promise to do something, he often punctuates the pledge by declaring, "Lunadi, " meaning literally, "By the moon" and figuratively, "It shall be done." In essence, he is promising the task will be done before the moon is full, although the actual terms of the agreement may be altogether different. "Lunadi" is often a figure of speech, like the giorgio habit of saying, "Swear to god," instead of, "It's really true." The Vistani think in terms of completing as much business as possible before Fulltide, so they can begin new projects afterward. The full moon marks a small turning point in the lives of a people who otherwise do not pay much attention to the passage of time.

On the third and last night, they also observe the **Lunaset**, a ritual which no outsider is allowed to attend. During this rite, the entire tribe files into the forest at midnight, when the moon is directly overhead. At dawn, as the moon sets, they finally re-emerge from the darkness-haggard in their looks, introspective in their demeanor and go straight to their beds to sleep until noon. When at last they rise, the Vistani seem as jovial as I have ever seen them.

In a land filled with **death**, the Vistani believe that they must shield their caravans from the taint of death. A Vistani's last act is often that of walking away from his caravan. If he cannot manage to do so himself, he is aided by his closest relatives and friends, though they do not speak to or look at him after he requests to be taken into the woods. The rest of the tribe similarly pretends not to see the dying person leave. This custom is yet another example of the Vistani value of privacy. The tribes believe that if one sees a Vistana take his last breath, the newly deceased literally died of embarrassment rather than of whatever was killing him in the first place. On the other hand, witnessing the death of a giorgio does not bother them in the least.


# Powers

The most iconic Vistani ability is to tell fortunes with any number of methods, tarokka most common. Females most commonly possess this power, and the seer most powerfully. Curiously, for all their ability to look into the past and future, the Vistani are apparently incapable of self-evaluation through the medium of prescience.

Arcanists who can travel and perhaps control the Mists. Charmers and negotiators who can have a calming influence on others. Crafters of curatives, poisons, tiny figurines of animals that come to life during the new moon. Speakers to animals.

The Vistani are also known for their ability to invoke curses. These can take the form of inconveniences, or scars, or they can be more cruel, creating the desire for something and making that thing deadly - used for retribution and to invoke feelings of loss. The doombringer curse, laid when the Vistani are most enraged, affects everyone around the victim instead of them. The victim becomes a carrier of devastating bad luck, a mystical disease to which he is immune. Finally, there are some curses that only a tribe's seer can invoke. The most infamous of them is the mishamel, the body-melt. A material possession of the victim is often used as the focus of the curse. To break them, one must look for loopholes in the text or use powerful magic.

All Vistani can use the evil eye, but females are more able and the seer and raunie are the most effective. A Vistani summons anger and hatred and directs it into the eyes of their adversary. Repeated exposure can make one increasingly better at resisting it. The most common effect is paralyzation, but other effects similar to magic can occur.
