# Nobility

Though most titles carry little in the way of land or wealth in [[Orilon]], the descendants of noble families still treasure their pedigrees and the commoners still envy them. Marriages of convenience between noble houses or between wealthy commoners and nobles are extremely common, and the blessing of Mahliet is highly sought-after for any couple starting a new life together, loveless or genuine. The importance of marriage is also evident in the Orilonian pantheon, which includes of five pairs of gods linked in marriage with the Lord and Lady foremost.


# Duels of Honour

Orilonians are a proud people and value the good name of themselves and their families, and retaliation against any who might wound this pride is not unusual. Illegal ways of seeking vengeance are discouraged, however, as they only serve to further tarnish the reputation of the injured party rather than restore it. Instead, duels to defend the honour of oneself and one's family are extremely common in Orilon. Duels are always observed by at least two witnesses, one from each side, as well as the divine gaze of Viel. In extreme cases of insult to one's honour, these duels are to the death.


## Production and Trade

Aside from fulfilling the needs of the Empire, Orilonians produce and trade in various luxury goods like wines, foods, textiles etc. They buy materials and work them into items of value. They also produce and sell spices and strange foods. They create delicate jewelry and ornamental weapons and armor of a different style to the dwarves, making them popular even among the elder race of master metalworkers. Much of the raw materials required for this production is supplied by the dwarves and Haran. Skilled craftsmen are highly regarded and said to possess "Irgund's spark".


## The Arts

Talent for the arts is considered a precious gift of Corvus, to be treasured and cultivated. Theatre, painting, sculpture and music are taught and practiced in the various Institutes of Arts across the Empire, which double as temples of Corvus. Talented individuals receive sponsorships from the state and various noble families to pursue and excel in their fields. This culture of celebrating and rewarding artists has earned the Orilonian Empire its reputation as a centre for creativity and culture throughout Illira.


## Diversity

Most of the original denizens of Orilon were human, and this remained so until they began to trade with the south and exchange people and ideas. A recent accord with the elves of Fennlor has further opened up the Empire's borders to other races. Though not as intolerant as it used to be, aspects of Orilonian society still show preferential treatment towards humans above other races.
