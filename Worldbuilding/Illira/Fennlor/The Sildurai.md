# General Info

Inside the domain of dread of the Mists, a lucky or perceptive adventurer might come across a variety of nests and small houses, blending in with the decaying forest. These are the residences of the Shadowfell’s fairy folk. But if lucky enough to encounter them, one might notice that they look much different than those living in Feywild or the Material plane. The few that know of their existence call them Entomen, but they are also known as Sildurai (elven for the final transformation of insects). 

Although still humanoid, they have many insect characteristics. Antennae, insectile wings or hard exoskeletons, each fairy family has one insect trait that they pass to their descendants. Some families can even pass special abilities of those insects. Poison stings, wall climbing feet or strong claws to name a few. Among them, one family is what would be considered nobility. The Weavers, possessing characteristics of spiders, are one of the oldest families of the fairy folk.


# History

## Relthwin

According to the history books, the Sildurai used to live in the feywild. The Weavers were storytellers, weaving intricate and interesting stories and some stories mention a few of them being able to turn them into reality. At some point the Sildurai were banished from the Feywild **for unknown reasons.** During these hard and confusing times, the Weavers provided a possible future for the Sildurai, a story of a new life in the most unexpected place, the Mists of Shadowfell. Due to their service, the Weavers are since well-respected and trusted. The Sildurai built a city they called Relthwin (refuge in elven).

The Mists, allowed them to live a secluded lifestyle, which the Sildurai preferred in the beginning, as it ensured their safety, having very few encounters with outsiders, mostly due to coincidence. However, at a point not well defined in the history books, they were visited by a group of people who called themselves the Vistani. 

This group had individuals who were sensitive to the threads of the future, which intrigued the Weavers and vice versa. Because of this similarity, they developed a bond, making them the first friendly group of people since their time in the feywild. The Sildurai treasured that bond, seeking to help the Vistani whenever they could, sending some of their people to accompany them on their travels, organizing events etc. This period of peace was long enough to now be considered the Golden period of their people. However, the story weaved for the Sildurai did not have an ending. And thus, there came a point that the Vistani warned them of a coming calamity, which would lead them to leave their home once again.

The Weavers had to use their power again to continue their story away from this place. However, no matter how hard they tried to make a happy ending true, they couldn’t. The Sildurai then decided to stay in the Mists. However, shortly after their home was attacked by a dragon of darkness. It became clear that the Mists were not a safe place for them anymore. Additionally, during this tragedy, they were unable to contact or communicate with the Vistani (who were busy with the situation with Malocchio).


## The Material Plane

Desperate, the Weavers used their power to weave a story of safety and life, regardless of their happiness and well being. This led them outside of the Mists, into Shadowfell and, due to the effect the Apocalypse had on planar travel, they eventually managed to Plane Shift to the Material plane. They found themselves in the north-west parts of the forest of [[Fennlor]] between Lathelond and Thaelal and when they eventually made contact with the Elves, they managed to negotiate with Varadkar, who promised them a place to live and rebuild, asking for a member of the Weavers to be magically trained, so they can study their strange power in return.

Although the Sildurai were under the protection of the Eternal Court, their appearance, especially of the Weavers, was strongly correlated with the Drow, to the minds of the Elves, leading to hostility varying from racist remarks to discreet violence.

However, besides the racism, the living conditions for the Sildurai were adequate. This only increased the Weaver’s anxiety, since they knew that this arrangement could not have a happy ending. They kept their part of the deal by sending their youngest daughter, Ranea, to study wizardry with a master of the Eternal Court. However they were carefully planning their new steps. They managed to secure a way to smuggle Ranea outside the darkness barrier with one mission: To find a suitable place for them to live.


# Weaving

Weaving is the name of the sacred art form of the Weavers. It is consisted of 3 parts: The Story, the Scroll and the Play.

The Story is quite self-explanatory. However, there are a few details that must be included in the Story for the Weaving to succeed. First, the story must include every person that desires to be affected by the Weaving, even if the part is small. Secondly, the accuracy and absurdity of the story affect the chances of success of the process. Not only the story must be at least possible, but the more specific it is, the higher the chances of success. For example, saying “we will meet a man that will help us find a new home” is much more unlikely to happen compare to “we will contact Varadkar, a high profile person of the Elves, who will agree to help us find a new home”. Thus, being informed about the state of the world is important in making a Story with high chances of success.

The Scroll is a large Scroll made by the Weavers. The quality of the material affects the chances of success of the Weaving. The best material is high quality silk. The Scroll depicts every step of the Story with short but meaningful imagery. Each scene must be connected with the next smoothly, as if they are one single large artwork rather than separate images sewed together.

The Play is the final part of the process. It is basically a theatrical representation of the Story. Every person included in the Story (and by extension, the Weaving) must play a part in the Play. This requires days of preparation and rehearsals. When the Play is ready, it must be performed uninterrupted. When the Play is over, the Weaving either succeeds or fails, depending on weather the conditions were met.

After the Play is performed and if the Weaving is successful, the Scroll needs to be sealed away and protected. The Weavers believe that if any part of the Story depicted on the Scroll is damaged before it has happened, it might not come to pass.
