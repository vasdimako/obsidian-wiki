# Fenn Wizards

The elves of [[Fennlor]] were the most magically gifted people of Illira and created magic as we know it - runes are based on ancient Elvish script and so on. The Great Library of Lathelond was famed throughout the land for its wise sages. After all, elves are perhaps best suited to wizardry out of all the races. They have centuries of life to devote to their studies, and their trance effectively gives them extra time to practice, as lessons learned during study can be reinforced by recalling them during resting periods. The rigidity and studiousness required by wizardry would seem anathema to a people who can recall a life of unfettered exploration and free expression of form, but magic provides a means of regaining that power. The patience and restraint for which elves are well known serves them well in this pursuit.


# Mythal

Great works of magic are by no means unique to elves, but the creation of mythals seems to be knowledge that did originate with them. Known by different names on different worlds, a mythal is a persistent magical field that changes how reality works over a large area. Creating the most powerful of mythals requires many wizards of great renown and long experience to engage in the same ritual, while lesser wizards feed spells into the growing webwork of magic. Such a ritual can take a long time to perform and sometimes requires the sacrifice of lives in order to achieve its purpose, but the results can be utterly miraculous.

A mythal can't be dispelled or suppressed by any conventional means, nor can its effects. Once one is in place, it seemingly lasts forever, since none are known to have dissipated. A mythal's nature can only be warped or changed, and that can be accomplished only through the use of magical energy equal to that required for its creation.


# The Banishment

The drow did not sit quietly in their dark home of the Underdark; on lightless nights, they would emerge and raid the elven settlements of the surface. Slaves, loot and chaos were their goals. Following a period of increasing drow activity that the Fenn had trouble holding back, the elven wizards of Lathelond decided on a bold and decisive action: they would weave a mythal, the largest that had ever been attempted, and seal off every passageway out of the Underdark and onto Illira's surface. The ritual was complex and required the participation of a hundred of the greatest sages of Lathelond. It claimed the lives of over half, but it was a success: the very structure of the Material Plane changed, all entrances to and from the Underdark closing off in a great upheaval of land. This lodged the Underdark itself in a strange limbo, not entirely part of the Material Plane but not entirely in another either. For all intents and purposes, the elves had created a new Plane of Existence, though they would not become aware of this fact for a very long time.


# The Great Rift

Emboldened by the success of their mythal, then elf-queen Amlaruil Moonflower tasked the wizards with another monumental task, a mere century after the Banishment: to weave a mythal that would bind a piece of Arvandor itself to the Material Plane, and allow elves to experience its glory within their own lands. All elves felt the longing to return to Arvandor constantly and strongly throughout their lives, and so this dangerous decision of the queen was met with enthusiasm by her people. Their intent was to craft a new homeland for the elves, a place protected from the outside world and so similar to their afterlife as to allow elves to live in a virtual heaven on earth.

Hundreds of years before the ritual began, elves prepared the place for the casting of the magic. The place was surrounded by small villages, where the elves lived. The gathering place itself was at a special place in the north shores of Illira. They built there a tower of white granite that reflected the colors of the sky. It was higher than any tower built by elves before. A stair curved along the inner wall and on each step was a seat of stone engraved with the name of the mage who would take their place on it during the casting. When everything was ready and the time of the casting neared, the best high mages of all of Fennlor gathered there.

Before sunrise, the mages took their seats and waited for the mage that functioned as the center of the ritual. It was a young wild elf named Starleaf. Her place was in the middle of the tower and she began a magical song and the mages joined in. They unleashed the magic of the Weave and funneled it through their bodies and fueled it with their own life forces, ripping their very souls from their bodies. Starleaf was the only one who survived the casting and she saw the others die. But she also felt the tremors of the earth as it was ripped apart to form an island in the Trackless Sea. The coast of Illira was destroyed by tremendous earthquakes and floods. Hundreds of elven settlements were destroyed and others were changed forever.

Although the performance of the ritual was an act of supreme sacrilege, it didn't bring divine retribution down on those responsible. Perhaps the Seldarine deemed the consequences of the act to be punishment enough. The ritual ripped continents apart. It shifted seas. The lives lost couldn't be counted. Even time and space were, for a time, torn asunder. This event was the Great Rift of Atus, and the world was forever changed by it.

Millennia later, Evermeet still exists, although now it is unmoored from the world, somewhere in the space between the Feywild, Arvandor, and the Material Plane. By using secret pathways, entering a fairy ring on special nights, or traversing a moonlit sea by following certain stars, elves of many worlds can get to Evermeet---if they're lucky. Even from Illira, for instance, one can sail to Evermeet only on a ship captained by an elf who has been there before. And if the captain slips up, the ship might become adrift on the Astral Plane.

Despite all these obstacles, when elves feel the pull of Arvandor, some find the way to assuage that feeling by traveling to Evermeet instead. Unlike on Arvandor, elves who visit Evermeet can do so for as long as they like and leave when they want-or can choose to stay, as many elves do in the later decades of their lives.

A side-effect of this grand upheaval was the emergence of the dwarf race from depths unknown in the mountains that would become known as Dur'Golar.


# Aftermath

The effects of the creation of Evermeet on the Material Plane would haunt the elves until the end of time. Their guilt at the destruction they had wrought was passed down to their descendants through their visions and trances. The elf race has an unspoken agreement not to speak of the events that occurred then, though they still remember them - they simply consider their lesson learned. No large group of wizards has ever been formed by elves since, and though they still practice the arcane, they prefer to do so individually or by channeling it through nature rather than traditional spells.
