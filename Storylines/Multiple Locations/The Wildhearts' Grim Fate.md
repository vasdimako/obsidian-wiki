## Milo's Body

[[Milo Montague]] had the misfortune to be targeted by Titivilus, regent of Dispater. Though the archdevil now knows Milo was not his intended target, the fact that the halfling was able to evade his curse vexes him and he wishes to stop Milo from obtaining a new body.

Eomund has completed preparations for transferring Milo's soul into a warforged body prepared specifically for him. A standard warforged creation room has been prepared in Harrowstone Keep, the new HQ of the RSAE. It is protected from most outside influence, but it cannot keep a being of Titivilus's power out. The process begins by peeling back the layers of protection that contain Milo's soul. When it is nearly exposed, the smell of sulfur fills the room and a thin, vertical crack appears on the wall and glows red. It rapidly expands.

At the same time, a flame bursts into existence in the centre of the room and a humanoid form emerges inside it as it burns out. It is familiar: a narzugon the players have encountered before, bearing a lance of pure flame and wearing black iron plate armour. He is named Agvarax the Relentless, leader of the Black Legion, a group of devils the archdevils often call upon to capture difficult prey. He calls for the Black Legion to march, summoning three black abishai as he raises his lance. He seems surprised to see the party but attacks them nonetheless.

The form of Titivilus wrapped in shadow and black smoke reaches out, his eyes bright red coals. He reaches out and begins to draw Milo's soul out of its bindings and through the crack. Each turn he is not damaged, he draws Milo further from his bindings and fully into hell in five turns. If he takes more than 63 damage in one turn, Milo is not drawn that turn. More than 127 damage, and the drawing is actually reverted by one turn.
