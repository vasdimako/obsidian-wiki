## Therendor, 1507

Following a period of civil unrest in the Kingdom of Bryton, the army was ordered to return to Mellen rather than guard the thus-far quiet southern border with Anvar. The Anvari army became aware of this movement very quickly and, with admirable preparedness, took advantage of it by marching north into Bryton territory. They were able to reach and lay siege to Mellen in less than a month, with very few minor skirmishes on the way. At the same time, a fleet of Anvari and mercenary ships blockaded the delta of Lanilet River, preventing access to and from Mellen’s port by sea.


## Thedas, 1507 - The Fall of Bryton

After two weeks under siege, representatives of the citizens and clergy of Mellen demanded the Brytons discuss terms with the Anvari invaders. The Brytons refused, trusting the strength of their walls and their allies of Whitehaven to break the siege. The citizens’ morale was bolstered when the renowned pirate Captain Davey made it through the blockade to deliver a hold full of supplies to the city, but their distribution was reportedly less than fair. The period of tension between government, clergy and citizens culminated into civil unrest on 16 Thedas, 1507. 

Much of the army was unwilling to defend the Brytons, but skirmishes broke out between loyalists and revolutionaries in the streets of Mellen. The Brytons’ lack of preparation due to their unwillingness to acknowledge the growing unrest within their walls led to the swift fall of the King’s Residence to the rebel forces. Leaders of the rebels would then negotiate peace with the Anvari, ceding sovereignty over the territories of the Kingdom of Bryton to Anvar in exchange for assurances that local government, religion and traditions would remain unchanged. 

By Rhaan, 1508 most of the local resistance by nobles that refused to acknowledge Anvar’s authority had been quashed. This effectively marked the dissolution of the Kingdom of Bryton and the end of the Brytons themselves. Whitehaven had no opportunity to send its armies in aid of their ally, as the Brytons’ fall was surprising and swift. After hearing of the events in Mellen, Wallace Sinclair set out to solidify his alliances with Highmountain, Royal Crydee and Rawcliffe. The princess Ralena travelled to Highmountain in a diplomatic mission and remained as the Rothgards’ guest for an extended period.

## Dravago, 1509 - The Siege at Crossroads

This marks the first major offensive move in the war since the siege of Mellen. The Anvari general, Jonan Adley, having spent a year and a winter solidifying power in the new northern territories, turned their attention to the west. The Anvari army marched on the Crossroads, a walled town serving as an important trading post a few miles into Highmountain territory. To avoid bloodshed, the Anvari lay siege on the town and wait for them to surrender.


## Lharvion, 1509 - Surrender of Highmountain

After two months of siege on the Crossroads with the town’s defenders close to starvation and exhaustion, the Anvari split their forces in two portions: the largest took the difficult path up the mountains to Holbreck, while the smallest remained to maintain the siege. They arrived outside the walls of Holbreck in Sypheros, with the first winter snows, and there was worry among the soldiers that they would be trapped in Highmountain that coming winter. However, after a brief siege lasting barely a week, the Rothgards surrendered their crown and were granted governance of their territories as dukes. The fall of Holbreck was, in all, impressively bloodless, and the Anvari found the princess of Whitehaven and her entourage in the city. She would be a hostage in Castath for the better part of the next decade.


## 23 Rhaan 1509

The besieging forces at Crossroads did not find the same success as those in Highmountain: on 23 Rhaan 1509, a force led by Borric conDoin from the south surprised the Anvari soldiers The besieging forces at Crossroads did not find the same success as those in Highmountain: on 23 Rhaan 1509, a force led by Borric conDoin from the south surprised the Anvari soldiers and was able to kill or imprison the vast majority of them. Though this did nothing to change the fate of Highmountain it was a crushing defeat for the Anvari, who lost about a third of their standing army that day. After this battle, the forces of Royal Crydee withdrew to the south and drew a battle line in Wrenford, vowing to stop the Anvari at the Lanilet. It is said that they sought the aid of Nirn but were refused by Raymond Blackmoor. 

The forces of Highmountain and Anvar marched southeast to protect the borders from conDoin’s forces and southwest to block Goldenridge Pass, the easiest route an army from Malvern might take when moving north. The next two years were spent in a stalemate with the forces of Crydee and deafening silence from Nirn, while King Dacane consolidated his power in the duchies of Mellen and Highmountain. Having lost their ally of Highmountain and their royal princess, Whitehaven sought to strengthen their border defences with the aid of the wizards of Rawcliffe.and was able to kill or imprison the vast majority of them.

## Barrakas, 1512

After nearly three years, the tension in Wrenford came to a head when Borric conDoin was found stabbed by the poisoned blades of an unknown assassin. He was succeeded by his daughter, Aretha conDoin, who began a lengthy and shrewd negotiation with King Dacane regarding the fate of Royal Crydee. In Olarune 1513, an agreement was reached under which sovereignty of Crydee was relinquished to King Dacane but their standing army and rights to trade goods with Arlan (and by extension Orilon) were maintained. 

This was a large concession on the Anvari side, as the Kingdom normally disallowed trade with the Orilonians. The Anvari dedicated their next year to building fortifications on the borders to Whitehaven and in negotiations to reach a similar agreement with their western neightbours. Wallace Sinclair demanded his daughter be returned before any negotiations were made and, having secured Rawcliffe’s aid, was reportedly unafraid of Anvar’s military superiority. The negotiations did not bear fruit.


## Therendor, 1514 - The Battle of Goldenridge Pass

In 1514, a portion of the Anvari army marched south into Nirn territory with the intention of laying siege to Malvern. On 24 Lharvion they were intercepted by Nirn’s army, led by Raymond Blackmoor, at Goldenridge Pass. The southern armies proved superior to Anvar’s in their mobility and striking power, and Blackmoor’s tactics took advantage of the mountainous terrain in a way General Adley did not consider. The Anvari army suffered a crushing defeat and was forced to retreat. After a few weeks, King Dacane invited representatives of Nirn to Castath to negotiate. An agreement was reached in Vult, 1514. The Blackmoors pledged to protect the southern border from any who would threaten it, as they had been for decades, and recognized Ernhard Dacane as sovereign. In exchange, they demanded absolute independence in military matters and established a process for ratifying the king’s decrees in Nirn.


## Dravago, 1516 - The Battle of Fort Raleigh

With five of the six kingdoms unified, King Dacane’s attention turned to Whitehaven. Several minor skirmishes occurred in 1515 near the Springrush, and a hard border between the two kingdoms was established in a series of fortifications built along the river. Diplomacy between the two kingdoms had reached a stalemate, and Anvar seemed to be preparing to push into Whitehaven’s territory. The tension culminated into large-scale conflict in Dravago, 1516, east of Whitehaven. 

The armies of Whitehaven aimed to take a fort established by the Anvari very close to the city, but the Anvari were prepared and countered the attack. The forces of Anvar were more numerous but the army of Whitehaven, led by Jonathan Sinclair, was bolstered by the presence of Rawcliffe’s wizards. The Battle of Fort Raleigh, as it would later be known, ended in a stalemate. Both sides suffered extensive losses, including the death of General Adley on the Anvari side, and much of the fort and surrounding forest lay in ruin from the wizards’ destructive spells. 

The wizards of Rawcliffe pressured Wallace Sinclair to avoid any further open conflict, while the Anvari forces sought to do the same, retreating behind battle lines. This marked the beginning of a four-year period of Cold War between the two kingdoms, where neither side was certain of what the outcome of all-out war would be and thus avoided it.


## Olarune, 1519

In the period of the Cold War, agents of King Dacane are said to have met in secret with the Council of Eight in Rawcliffe. An agreement was reached on 12 Olarune 1519, later termed the Statute of Arcane Matters: in exchange for Rawcliffe remaining neutral in the conflict between the two kingdoms, Anvar pledged to instate a court-wizard position in every major duchy in the Kingdom so that Rawcliffe could better advise and protect the local governments on arcane matters. This was revealed later; at the time, the Council only declared they would be neutral in all matters pertaining to the war from then on. 

Having lost the support of Rawcliffe, Wallace Sinclair resumed negotiations with King Dacane. It was agreed that Whitehaven would become a part of the Kingdom of Anvar and that the Sinclair family would relinquish their titles and lands. In exchange, the princess would be returned to her family and no blood, royal or otherwise, would be spilled in this exchange of power. After this agreement was made, the Anvari army marched to Whitehaven with the King at its head, to oversee the transition in power. 

However, the Anvari were ambushed in the streets of Whitehaven by the local army, a force led by Jonathan Sinclair. The ensuing battle lasted three days and there were many losses on both sides, as well as citizens of Whitehaven killed. The Anvari were ultimately victorious, and Jonathan Sinclair was heavily wounded and imprisoned. In response, the King decreed the Sinclairs present in Whitehaven traitors to be executed. The War of Unification finally ended in 14 Zalantyr, 1520 when King Dacane took Estella Thornwood, second in line to the now dissolved monarchy of Whitehaven, as his bride in Castath. By this time, pockets of resistance in the region of Whitehaven had been quashed by the new duke, Darryl Ramsworth, and the wedding served as a final, symbolic declaration of unity between the six regions under the banner of Anvar.
