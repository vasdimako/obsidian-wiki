# The Lord of Hexes

When the [[Tenebrous Cabal]] was first created, it was little more than a gathering of arcanists and researchers with similar goals and outlook. They all sought to better understand the Shadowfell's gloom and wield it for their own purposes. Dark begets dark and so the group grew quickly with new members. Most had little aptitude for bending the shadow and learned only paltry tricks, while others became masters at their chosen field. They formed the Circle of Tenebrous Masters and began the dark, secret practice that birthed the Lord of Hexes.

New recruits had to complete a variety of challenges before being admitted into the Cabal. During these challenges and without the participants' knowledge, the Circle's magic would strike at their soul, breaking off and consuming a piece of it. Those who resisted were considered to have great potential and most went as far as becoming members of the Circle eventually. The others did not realise what the Circle had done to them, for the damage to their soul was small. Their lifespan ended up a few days shorter, but they would never know that.

Before the Circle could complete whatever dark purpose they were collecting soul shards for, the shards rebelled mid-ritual. The pieces of soul lashed out with a strange intelligence, pushing back their captors and merging into a new, powerful being. Suddenly, the Circle was fighting to preserve their own souls. The being took control of the Cabal quickly, replacing disloyal or unbending Circle members with its own. It took on the name "Lord of Hexes" and erased all knowledge of how it had come to be.

The Lord of Hexes had absolute control over the Cabal until a promising recruit began to climb the ranks - an elf by the name of Varadkar. His mastery over shadow magic was unparalleled, and the Circle was preparing to receive its new member. Before his initiation, Varadkar demanded to see the Lord of Hexes - a taboo. The Lord of Hexes demanded, it was not demanded of. It rushed to meet Varadkar, intending to teach him his place. Instead, it found the elf was too powerful - holding an orb of pure darkness as his spellcasting focus, Varadkar bent the Lord of Hexes to his will. And so it has been to this day - Varadkar turned down the position in the Circle, claiming the Lord of Hexes did not approve, and left for Planes unknown. The Lord of Hexes continued to lead the Cabal, its direction unchanged, but performed any tasks Varadkar asked of it willingly and secretly. Any resources, scrolls or information the Cabal had, Varadkar also had.

The Lord of Hexes wishes to create a body for itself. Any bodies it has possessed so far have quickly disintegrated from the inside out, unable to contain it. Varadkar has displayed remarkable ability in preserving elven bodies past their death, so there is a carrot as well as a stick: the Lord of Hexes does not resist because it hopes Varadkar is the key to gaining physical form.

## Initiation

Several simple tasks for those that seem unskilled at magic. First, a demonstration of current skills before the Council. If someone more skilled turns up, they are taken straight to the final test, though it is presented as an honour - they are transported to the Tenebrous Archive, a demiplane containing a vast library as well as the amorphous form of the Lord of Hexes. They may peruse the archive as they wish, but there is no obvious method to its organisation.

The Index Incarnatus, a tome containing the location of everything in the archive, can be consulted for information. For each document or tome located, it attempts to absorb a part of the user's soul.

The weak-minded may be lost in the archive forever, and eventually the Lord of Hexes claims their soul.
