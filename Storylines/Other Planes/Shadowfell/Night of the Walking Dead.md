# Night of the Walking Dead

Luke and Marcel Darkton are members of the Crimson Sashes, born in a village within the Mists called Orlane. They left the village as quickly as they could and left a third brother, John, behind. John wanted to maintain their family fortune and property, a plantation in the village. He had also found dark, maddened writings of one of their ancestors detailing a secret Darkton fortune hidden somewhere in Orlane, including a powerful Vistani scroll. Fiora, an old woman who had met old Peter when she was little, was the only villager that knew of John's search.

Recently, John came to [[Gloomwrought]] and recruited/convinced his brothers to join him. He claimed to have found the location of the Darkton fortune and needed help recovering it. Their ancestor obsessed about hiding this scroll along with a bag of priceless diamonds. John wanted the diamonds but his description of the scroll seemed to draw Marcel's attention. He quickly became obsessed with getting his hands on the scroll, believing it was the key to power.

The three brothers came to live in John's townhouse in the village and began their search. They were certain the scroll was somewhere nearby, for their ancestor Pierre was known to have lived here his whole life. Eventually, the brothers solved the riddle and sought the scroll in a crypt, part of the sealed Old Cemetery. They entered through a secret passage they found. The night was dry and the moon was bright so they felt secure. When Luc unrolled the scroll and read it, the dead of the crypt rose and attacked. They were too many, and Marcus was slain in the process.

Distraught, John and Luke brought their dead brother to Reverend Bruce. The Reverend was persuaded to use his one remaining scroll of Raise Dead on the poor man, but his spell failed. John and Luke took their brother's body away to prepare him for burial, until he moved. They both realised their brother had become undead, the Reverend's spell twisted. Luke was horrified by this, but John decided to protect his brother even in this state.

Death had not dulled Marcel's desire for the scroll, and John lied that it had been lost in the crypt. Marcel returned there to look for it, and quickly realised he could command other dead to rise and do his bidding. John seemed obsessed with "helping" Marcel, either because his mind had snapped from seeing his brother rise or because the scroll's foul magic had affected him too. The following night, John instructed the servants to prepare a mysterious meat for a somber dinner. Luke had a bad feeling and stayed in his room, feigning grief, but realised John was desperate that everyone in the household ate. The following night, Luke stalked John and found out how he intended to help Marcel: he watched as John slew one of his fellow villagers, removed their heart, kidneys and liver for his pantry and brought the gutted body to the cemetery, to be raised by Marcel.

The sight of what had become of his two brothers became too much for Luke and he fled to the swamp, retreating within himself from the trauma. He had been the one to read out the scroll, so surely their fates were his fault! Reverend Bruce was the only one who realized this, and brought Luke food and company when he could.

Marcel often came into town the following weeks and his foul presence resulted in the sudden deaths and subsequent raisings of nine villagers. The first two escaped their coffins as zombies, while the remaining seven were sealed into theirs. A field worker named Hogarth was first, and the constable's son was second. They both inexplicably fell to the ground and rose as zombies shortly after.

A further six villagers are missing. Red licorice pieces were found along with some of their things, as well as a large amount of blood.

## The Scroll

The scroll contains information about a sign that occurs in this adventure that suggests a scion of darkness that spells doom for all Vistani and is immune to the evil eye is finally at full power. The content of the scroll - its discussion of the Drakkar, makes them desecrated and gives them dark power.

>"Look for the scroll where the old rest fine, behind the stone where six stars shine.
>But the finding will cause much pain, beware the time of dark moon and falling rain."

"These signs were foretold by Hyskosa, one most gifted with the sight.

> The night of evil shall descend on the land,
When these signs are near at hand:<br>
In the house of Dagon the sorcerer born,
'Tween life and unlife, all living shall scorn.
His Vistana mother's heart, dark and perverse,
Shall doom the Mists to the dreaded curse.
The lifeless child of stern mother found,
Heralds a time of evil unbound.<br>
When the light of the sky,
Darkens and turns foul,
And the Crown of Souls,
comes to rest upon his brow,<br>
Will the Drakkar awaken,
Of age, to rule the Mists,
Until no Vistani in this realm exists.

Spread his words wherever you travel, only the true-hearted can stop the fall of evil's night."
