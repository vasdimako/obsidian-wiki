# The Garwaters

The Lovers want to explore a continent to the far, far west that one of their ships spotted from afar in the midst of a storm. The sea between the two continents is dangerous, and no other ships have ever made it that far. One of the Garwater ships saw a strange airship near Armada, and with the help of the Grand Gears were able to follow and commandeer it. The crew fought to the death for the grace of the Emperor.

The Lovers are also annoyed with the situation with the Nocturne - they feel that their authority should not be challenged the way the Nocturne are doing, and they are worried about reports that the Nocturne are draining blood from members of other crews. However, they want to present a front of unity among the crews and wouldn't share this unless with proven enemies of the Nocturne or trusted agents.


# The Grand Gears

The Grand Gears have been working on magical engineering for a long time, and the Bookwyrm is somewhat annoyed at the fact that it is booming in Anvar thanks to aetherium. Some Grand Gears consider using aetherium too easy and that it is above them, while others don't mind it. In any case, they definitely aren't above smuggling aetherium from the Renvar Isles to [[Armada]] and then selling it or transporting it to markets outside Anvar. The Bookwyrm will buy any books or interesting tidbits of knowledge and is generally an affable woman.


# The Nocturne

The Nocturne was created by Cassius a long time ago to tame the waters, one of the weaknesses of vampires. He was a powerful undead and spellcaster that used blood magic and taught this to others in his crew. Malik became his second-in-command and Ireena his consort, and the crew's power grew. They had some skirmishes with the Garwaters and eventually made peace after they worked together to subdue a royal navy ship and created Armada. Very soon afterwards, Malik and Ireena betrayed Cassius and locked him inside a coffin and threw him into the ocean.

The Nocturne charm potential recruits in a mundane or magical manner. The recruits can then ascend through the ranks by dying and rising as vampire spawn, and then eventually may be allowed to become full vampires. Joining the Nocturne requires relinquishing a great amount of control in exchange for the immortality of undeath. Fully-fledged vampires that have not risen through the ranks are rarely allowed to become trusted members. Malik's personal bodyguard

The Kaanthi are working with Malik and the Nocturne as an avenue to procure blood for their champion's empowerment. This has led Malik to escalate his collection efforts, sometimes even charming other pirate crews and draining them. In the night, there is evidence of the Nocturne or even Malik himself making rounds.


# The Sealords

The Sealords are archetypal pirates but they take advantage of their amphibious nature by attacking ships silently from the sea, without making their presence known. They also have sharks and other sea life as pets that follow their ships and aid them in hunting undersea prey, be it sailors trying to swim away or things of the deep. Nills believes breathing air is a necessary evil but that it corrupts creatures in the long run compared to the purity of the sea.

Members of the Sealords are being assassinated in gruesome and public ways, and the players may be recruited to investigate if they enquire about it. The perpetrator is a revenant whose ship and crew got slaughtered and plundered by the Sealords. She was a minor Anvari noble sorceress on board and returned as a revenant to get revenge. She calls herself the Widow but was called Amanda Blackmoor.

Sahuagin refugees have gone to the Sealords for help after the maniac halfling destroyed their home. They have been given Chiara's description and wanted posters for her have been put up.


# The Blackshanks

The Blackshanks are the latest addition to Armada and arguably fit in the least. They are the most numerous of the crews and believe in individual freedom above all. Their captain doesn't exactly give them orders while they're in Armada, but on their ships there's a clear chain of command. Their district is a lot of drinking and sex and fistfights, and the Garwaters rarely get involved other than as a show of strength.
