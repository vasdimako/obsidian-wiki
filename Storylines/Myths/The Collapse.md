Guiding souls to the afterlife afforded Azrael a degree of freedom from the bonds that limited other angels, though he was still stuck in the Driftwood Cathedral. The nature of his work was such that he touched all planes and remained active while the other angels were put to slumber. In time, Azrael began to yearn for more. Kelemvor did not deserve [[The Grey City]] - it was him that ruled them in fact, by governing which souls pass through them and to where, so why not in name also?

But the City were closed to him, past the Divine Gate, and even the Prime angel could not cross it under Helm's watchful eye. From the [[Driftwood Cathedral]], Azrael began to plan his ascension. Through the ferrymen and his shards, his reach was wide and he began to collect lost mortals and recruit them to his cause. The Watcher understood mortal souls well and promised them precisely what they desired. Some joined willingly, others were intimidated by show of strength, others still were tricked. Still, the numbers of the [[Deathforged]] grew rapidly, first in the [[Shadowfell]] and then throughout the Inner Planes. 

Azrael's followers performed a vile ritual to free the angel from his prison in the Driftwood Cathedral and allow him access to the Material Plane. There, Azrael took on the guise of the Yellow King for a time while his followers collected his shards and the keys of the Hermetic Tome, which contained the final pieces to their goal.

Eventually, all the pieces were in place and the Deathforged Ritual commenced in the Shimmering Plateau. A great darkness fell upon the Material Plane, and the recently deceased rolled in their graves. For three days, the light of the sun was gone from the world. On the second day, Rawcliffe and a human army consisting of Anvari and Orilonian forces attempted to put an end to the ritual. No aid came from the elves or dwarves, and the Enlightened of Elor remained silent. The human forces failed, and Rawcliffe was struck down from the sky by Azrael himself.

The ritual brought all of spacetime, every plane and every moment together at its point. The Divine Gate both existed and did not. This planar wormhole destabilized the Divine Gate enough for the empowered Azrael to fly through, shattering the boundary established in the Banishment. This was done with the aid of Lethe, who bridges the gap between Planes and wished to return to the Material.

Azrael made for [[The Grey City]], his halo shining with power and bathing the streets in pale light. He entered the Crystal Spire with the intent of facing [[Kelemvor]], but found the throne empty. Azrael sits on it ever since, finally in control of all aspects of the afterlife, his wish granted.


# Aftermath

Azrael's actions had unintended consequences for the entire universe. 

First, the act of violently passing through the Divine Gate shattered part of it, both figuratively and literally. Although the major deities have kept each other in check and have not interfered so far, there is no telling what minor deities, malicious or otherwise, may leak through.

Second, his first ritual of breaking the bonds of the Driftwood Cathedral weakened the bonds of all other angels and minor gods imprisoned within the Inner Planes.

Third, the act of contracting all of the Planes in one spot did irreversible damage to the boundaries between those Planes. As a result, travel between the Planes has become easier and, in places where the Planes once converged, they may now bleed together.

Finally, Kelemvor's fate is unknown. His clergy's prayers remain unanswered, or in some cases are answered by Azrael instead.
