# The First Sin

It is said that long ago, [[the Maker]] created [[the Fade]] as His first world. His first children were the spirits of the Fade, made in His own image. However, the Maker turned away from His first children, because while the spirits could alter their world at will, they lacked a soul and could only imitate what they saw, being unable to create or imagine anything new for themselves. Dissatisfied with the result, the Maker left the Fade behind, creating the world of Krynn instead and its inhabitants. He separated it from the first world by putting the Sevenfold Veil in between them, not realizing that His first children would be able to observe His new children and grow envious of them. 

The children that populated this new realm had the spark of the divine within them, which pleased the Maker. While their world was more solid than that of the spirits, these creatures were able to imagine, and dream new things because of it. Those possessing the most brilliant of sparks became the Primordial Gods, beings that exemplified aspects of the Maker's creation.

But then the Original Sin was committed: jealous spirits who would be the Profane Gods whispered to the men of the new world from across the Veil, and turned them to the worship of themselves. Through this worship, the Profane Gods were able to come physically across the Veil.

The Primordial and Profane Gods fought fiercely, for the Profane were motivated by jealousy and vengeance and aimed to destroy. The Maker was saddened by this and sought to imprison the Profane Gods, but found the Primordials too embroiled in conflict to aid him. As a result, the Maker turned away from mankind and departed from the Eternal City. He despaired, for His first children had no urge to create and His second children created sin. 

Much later on, [[Andraste]] managed to convince the Maker to forgive his creations, but Andraste was betrayed by her mortal husband Maferath, and burned at the stake. The Maker turned away from mankind once more. 

# Present Day

As of the present day, the Maker has long since left the world. [[The Chantry]] teaches that one day, when the Chant of Light is sung from all the corners of the world, the Maker will finally return and transform the world into a paradise. Until that day, however, He only watches for those few who follow Andraste's teachings. When they die, the Maker brings them to his side. 

All others wander the Outer Planes or even the Fade throughout eternity, forever lost to the Maker's sight. The Chantry says that they throw themselves to the "Void." The motive to create paradise in the world by spreading the Chant is often cited as the reason the Chantry called an Exalted March against the elves of the Dales, who refused to worship a 'human' god, or others against the Tevinter Imperium where the Chant has been deemed as corrupted in favor of their magister rulers to regain their leadership as in the old days before the first Blight.
