# Description

This book, written by renowned high elven historian Rendel Theran, recounts the history of the northern Illiran human kingdoms from its beginning until the War of Unification.

## The Arrival - Year 1400

The colonisers, humans in vast majority, landed in the northern shores of Illira after months at sea. Many of them claimed some degree of nobility and brought with them loyal vassals: artisans, arcanists and men-at-arms. These were the leaders that went on to establish the seven kingdoms of the north in the following decades.

## The Holy Orilonian Empire

The humans that landed in the east were led Reyner de Barad, a noble that claimed to be second in line to an ancient throne. After establishing a small settlement, Ortan, de Barad went on to claim the surrounding land in the name of the Holy Orilonian Empire and name himself Emperor. His authority was recognised by most of the settlers that came with him aside from a single family and their retainers, who travelled further inland and settled just north of the river Anor. This later became a small barony under the Orilonian protectorate, Arlan.

The Fenn and island tribes to the south of [[Orilon]] were initially wary of the human settlers, and the relationship was further strained by the humans' reluctance to allow other races into their lands. This isolationist policy was maintained by Reyner's son, Azor. Though the Empire's relations with its neighbours were frosty for much of the next century, trade still occurred between them as well as Elor by sea. The goods produced by Orilonian artisans became renowned and sought-after across Illira. The Orilonian government and religious leadership proved extremely effective in maintaining peace and contentment in their populace, and most citizens saw their Emperor as a chosen of the Gods.

Relations with the western kingdoms were tense: de Barad claimed to be the only legitimate ruler in Illira as a direct descendant of the royal family. The six western kingdoms took every opportunity to discredit the Orilonians' claims, which led to some hostile exchanges and an eventual cease in all trade and diplomatic relations. Neither side ever moved to declare war, partly due to the lack of military power in the fledgling kingdoms and partly due to the logistical difficulties posed by the Kaan Plains.

In 1507, the Emperor of Orilon Francis de Barad, son of Azor, made the decision to extend an offer of alliance and cooperation towards the Fenn, and began discussions with the tribal island communities and the barony of Arlan that resulted in their annexation as part of Orilon in return for protection. At the same time, construction work began on a great wall that would defend the land of Orilon from any land assault. These actions were taken due to growing concern about the situation in the west.


## The Western Kingdoms

The colonisation of the north-west was not nearly as uneventful. Disagreements over which noble family's pedigree was superior led to conflicts that seemed likely to escalate. No battles or skirmishes were fought, because the settlers could scarcely afford to lose any of their number. Instead, the groups with the most military power were able to claim Illiran land as their own first.


### The Kingdom of Bryton

House Bryton possessed the greatest military might and was therefore able to settle where the humans initially landed, near the delta of Dhughgolar, which they called Lanilet River. They approached a small religious community that had formed around four ancient temples near the coast and began to build their city, Mellen, around them.

The Brytons were not particularly gifted rulers, and their kingdom failed to take full advantage of its strategic position. When the Church of Symmetry was established in Whitehaven in 1440, the Brytons did not allow clerics and envoys of the religion into their territory. This and their refusal to engage in trade with Haran due to suspicions that Orilonian goods were being sold there were the first of a series of decisions that isolated the kingdom from its neighbours and disillusioned its citizens from the ruling class.


### The Kingdom of [[Anvar]]

House Dacane sailed up the Dhughgolar and found a spot where the river split around a long island. Raleigh Dacane, their leader, envisioned two grand castles on the island's northern and southern tips that would provide control over river traffic. They established Castath on the riverbank opposite the island and sailed further inland to explore where the river led.

The river provided a fast and safe passage to Dur'Golar, and the dwarves welcomed a steady stream of mutual trade with the north. Soon, a castle was built on the long island as well as a port on its south side. Trade between Castath and Dur'Golar grew exponentially over the next sixty years, and the wealth it generated allowed a series of extraordinary terraforming and infastructure projects in Castath as well as Raleigh Dacane's intended monopoly over the Lanilet traffic.


### The Kingdom of Whitehaven

House Sinclair, led by Tybalt Sinclair, continued along the coast to the west and sailed up the River Eld. Their explorers discovered the mountains the Eld sprung from was rich in marble and minerals, and the temperate forests around it could be a source of timber and food. They established Whitehaven at the confluence of the Eld and the Springrush.

Over the next century, a series of shrewd actions by Sinclair placed Whitehaven in an extremely advantageous position in the north. First, they established the Church of Symmetry and funded the construction of a great tower to serve as the religion's centre and holy site. The ideas and worship expressed by the Church were similar to the old dwarven religion but organised in an unprecedented way. Then, Ivywood was established in the coast opposite Mellen in 1450 as a calling point to facilitate the trade with Haran that the Brytons refused. Finally, Sinclair fostered a close relationship with the wizards of Rawcliffe and participated in their efforts to install wizards in the six kingdoms' courts, ensuring a positive relationship with the body of arcanists.


### Highmountain

What House Rothgard lacked in military power, they made up for in their ingenious engineers and artisans. They first sailed and then walked further inland, following the Springrush until they found a resource-rich and well-protected valley in the Beor Mountains. Holbreck was little more than a mining town for a long time, but its rulers and citizens grew very rich from the ore and gems they extracted as demand for such things increased in the surrounding kingdoms. The Rothgards never attempted to expand their lands or seize political power but maintained friendly relationships with all three of their neighbours, including a series of marriages.


### The Kingdom of Nirn

Philip Blackmoor foresaw conflict between the various new rulers and decided to lead his people further south, sailing around the Beor and into the Bay of Nirn. He established Malvern in a hilly part of the continent only easily accessible from the coast. Blackmoor's explorers were the first agents of the west kingdom to encounter the elves and dwarves.

Over the next few decades, Malvern came into contact and conflict with the Wild Tribes of Old Nirn, the Shimmering Plateau. They built a series of forts along the southern coast of the Bay, but were unable to hold them consistently against the tribes. The tumultuous relationship sometimes led in extremely profitable trade with the tribespeople but also required Blackmoor to maintain a well-trained standing army.


### Royal Crydee

The sixth kingdom was established twenty-five years after the rest. Raleigh Dacane secretly ordered her general, William conDoin, to create a settlement to the east in order to facilitate trade with Orilon and the elves. They founded Crydee. Though the terrain north of the Black Marsh was not ideal for human settlement, the citizens quickly adapted to their new environment.

When Raleigh Dacane was succeeded by her son Sebastian, who ordered the general to abandon any relationship with Orilon and Fennlor and return to Castath, William conDoin declared Crydee's independence from the Kingdom of Anvar, which was maintained until the War of Unification some seventy years later.


### Rawcliffe

Though not one of the seven kingdoms, understanding the history of Rawcliffe is vital for a scholar of the northern human politics. The wizards that landed in Illira during the Arrival did not serve specific noble houses, save for a handful. Instead, the group sought to establish its own base, a centre for learning of the arcane arts. The wizards built a small tower at the northwest edge of the continent and began to take in apprentices of all races. This was the first organised teaching centre for arcane matters since the end of the Twelve in Fennlor, and drew interest from all over the continent.

After establishing Rawcliffe as an academic power, the wizards set out to increase their political influence while maintaining independence from the surrounding human kingdoms. In 1498, the wizards came to an agreement with Wallace Sinclair of Whitehaven to instate a court wizard position in the kingdom. No agreement was reached with the other five kingdoms until after the end of the War of Unification.


## Afterword

The observant reader may notice the events detailed in this tome are referred to as a colonization, and there are several mentions of noble titles, courts and royal families but not of the kingdom they originate from. The humans that sailed for Illira were aware that certain events in their homeland drove them to search for a new home in a different continent but had no recollection of what those events were. In fact, when questioned, most humans failed to see why their lack of memories of why they migrated was abnormal. Very few details of what life in the continent they originated from was like survived the travel; the Orilonian Empire claims to have kept the old traditions alive but, when pressed for details, would admit they did not recall ever observing those traditions before coming to Illira.



This evidence suggests magical tampering with the memories of the entire human race, but who would be capable of such a feat and their reasons for doing so are not within the purview of this historical account. The short human lifespans and initial lack of interest in exploring this collective amnesia may mean these questions will never be answered.
