# Reclaiming the Faestone


## The Faestone

A relic of the elven people, the Stone of Anor or Faestone is thought to have mystical power beyond its importance as an ancient artifact. It was originally housed in a temple in the forest close to Ryanora and the source/headwaters of the Anor. The circumstances that led to it being lost are not well-understood, but this event coincided with the fall of Fennlor forest west of Anor to corruption and its eventual transformation to the Black Marsh. The current rulers of [[Fennlor]] have sent the Nammar an Varne, an elite organisation, to retrieve the stone. They have sent Tylis (Crystal-breeze) Ruanin (Star-rite) and Seinor Zamil (royal gift) to achieve this. Seinor is the second in command of the Nammar an Varne and Tylis is a noble daughter of the Ruanin family and valued member.


## Marah Sutoma's Defenses

[[Marah Sutoma]] purchased the Faestone for an astronomical amount of money from a shady source. It is her most prized possession and she values and protects it especially for that reason. It is surrounded by a magical, golden mesh that keeps its magical properties sealed which is only removable by Marah herself. Marah wears it around her neck on an unbreakable golden chain at all times and takes it off during the night. She places it in an enchanted wooden box that is alarmed and arcane locked unless opened with a special key in her possession. Additionally, unless it is opened by an individual humming Marah's favourite tune, a symbol spell inscribed on the inside of the lid is triggered.

She also has several well-trained Marshals watching the outside of her house, as a member of the Mercantile Assembly, and several mercenaries in the interior of the house itself.
