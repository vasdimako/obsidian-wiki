[[Gloomwrought]]

The gray and black armor and cloaks of the Deathless Watch distinguish the members of Gloomwrought's primary law enforcement agency. Each member's dented armor and torn clothing hint at every battle that individual has fought. Officers reek of blood, attesting to each warrior's hard-earned stature. 

The guards view any chance to enforce the law as a way to pocket a few more coins. Accepting bribes is by far the most common form of law enforcement. The laws the Watch "enforces" depend on what it catches a person doing and how much money the guards think a person has. 

Anybody who calls for the Watch for help in a crisis is either na√Øve or desperate. Even when forced into action, the guards feel little sympathy for victims. They consider anyone of less than noble standing in the city to be a lowlife who deserves what he or she gets.
