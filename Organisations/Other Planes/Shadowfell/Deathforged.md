[[Gloomwrought]]

A cult formed by Oristus when he was visited by the Queen of Night's angel Azrael in his sleep. The deathforged believe Azrael must be set free so that he can destroy the divine gate and allow Shar and the Profane Pantheon to conquer the universe once more. Or at least, that was Azrael's initial promise to them; the cult's focus has since shifted to establishing Azrael as the prime power in the Material Plane.

They perform strange rituals and prayers to Azrael, and the angel responds to them in cryptic and eldritch ways, often with visions and dreams that drive their minds closer to the brink and deeper into service. The Deathforged are changed when they are touched by Azrael in this way, taking on a pallid, undead appearance. It is unclear whether they are truly alive or not.

It was the Deathforged, both in the Shadowfell and the Material Plane, that helped Azrael leave his prison of the Driftwood Cathedral. Their work in Gloomwrought and the Shadowfell is not finished, however: they are working to shift the direction of Shar worship in the city towards the angel of Death.
