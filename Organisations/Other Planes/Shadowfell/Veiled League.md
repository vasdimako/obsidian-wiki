[[Gloomwrought]]

The Veiled League operates the majority of illicit enterprises within Gloomwrought. It also runs the city's central edifice of self-indulgence, the House of Sterling. This business puts the organization in a unique position within the city. Even the cautious might allow information to slip when in an altered state of mind or in the arms of a paramour. Amid the everchanging alliances and hostilities of Gloomwrought's factions, knowledge is vital. 

The Veiled League openly brokers, transmits, and protects such facts. The organization claims to be neutral in Gloomwrought's politics. It's not difficult to learn about the group's operations. The Veiled League acquires knowledge, and it ensures the secure delivery of sensitive information for customers. Any lore it gathers is supposedly available to the highest bidder.

The League governs itself through an advisory board called the Veiled Council, made up of influential members. A mysterious entity known as the Monger stands at the head of the Veiled League. Although the Monger is rumored to be a humanoid, few know more than that about this figure. Some think the Monger is an imaginary being invented to conceal the group's true leadership or a title that has been given to multiple individuals over time. 

The truth is that the Monger is an elder black dragon named Ushawabti. Able to assume any humanoid form, she enjoys the variety of experiences the league offers and the air of mystery that surrounds her. She revels in the fact that she and her group are so important in Gloomwrought.
