The Eternal Chantry has been a highly influential religious organization across the Astral Plane and its denizens. It is based on the Chant of Light, a series of teachings written by Andraste, the prophet of the Maker, and her disciples. The Chantry is a denomination of Andrastianism; its followers are known as Andrastians. 

The Chantry's goal is to spread the Chant of Light to all four corners of the world and to all races. Once all peoples have accepted the Chant and practice its teachings, the Maker will return and restore the world to its former glory. As such, Andrastian religion in Krynn can be described as deistic in that the Maker abandoned the world, and he will not heed prayer or perform any other function until his favor is regained. However, Chantry clerics can still perform spells or miracles and this fact has been instrumental in Andrastianism taking root.

Led by Divine Justinia V, the Chantry's influence was mostly confined in the large settlements of the Astral Plane until the Collapse. Since then, their considerable resources have been invested in spreading Andraste's teachings and the Chant of Light to all corners of Atus, now easily accessible to them.

# Worship

Members of the Chantry often worship in buildings called chantries. These chantries are present in almost every village, town and city and some will also maintain a Chanter's Board, where members of the community can put up requests for aid. Chantries also deliver practical services to the community, caring for the sick and collecting alms for the poor. The Chantry provides hospitality to travelers and a public network of communications. Should an illiterate commoner need to send word to another town, the Chantry's educated priests write and send the letter for him. Revered mothers are also able to officiate wedding ceremonies and legalize marriages. 

A core belief of the Chantry is that the use of aetherium must be controlled - it brings individuals closer to the Fade, which goes against the Maker's will and must only be undertaken by select individuals who believe in and have been chosen by the Maker.

## The Chant of Light

The Chant is divided into Canticles and sub-divided into stanzas and then verses. The entire Chant of Light takes several weeks to recite. The Chant of Light is a collection of chants that together comprise the religious texts of the Chantry. It is based on the tale and teachings of Andraste, bride and prophet of the Maker and was probably first created circa 1065 TE (-130 Ancient) by her disciples who collected these into hymns after her death. This original Chant of Light consisted of four Canticles, known collectively as "the Portents". The four Canticles are Threnodies, Andraste, Transfigurations, and Trials.

The Chant covers a wide range of subject matter such as cosmogenesis, human history, the story of Andraste, and the founding of the Chantry. Some are simply collections of hymns. Some are the specific teachings of the Chantry while others are meditations on the Maker or encouragement to the faithful. Even within a Canticle, the same story may be told more than once with different styles, as each stanza may have been composed by a different disciple. 

## Vision of the Maker

From an early age, Andraste suffered from troubling dreams of a deity known as the Maker. Over time she began to interpret these dreams as the answer to questions that plagued her, and she came to believe that the Maker was the supreme being who had abandoned the world when his people took up the worship of the Old Gods. 

It is said that Andraste despaired at the fate of her people, stuck on the inhospitable expanses of Rhaan. Every night, her husband would console her and she would shed a single tear, which he captured in a vial, and sing a song of hope. On the thirtieth night the vial was full, and when dawn came Andraste saw her first vision of the Maker. Enchanted by her voice, the Maker invited Andraste to join Him at His side. She instead encouraged Him to return to humanity and forgive them, compelling her fellow Alamarri and others to accept the one true god of Thedas.

# Templar Order

The Templar Order is the military of the Chantry. They are paladins and warriors who use aetherium to enhance their powers. Templars are officially deemed a force of defenders by the Chantry. Their advocates claim they are saviors, holy warriors, protectors of the innocent, and champions of all that is good. Others see them as symbols of the Chantry's control over magic and aetherium with a religious fervor that inspires absolute devotion to their mandate rather than moral principles. Their roles are to protect the communities of the faithful from magical threats.
