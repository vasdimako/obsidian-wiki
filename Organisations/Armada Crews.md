# The Garwaters

The Lovers are a pair of captains that rule Armada. They are a pair of half-elves that descend from sea-elves. Their sailing flagship is called the Arrogance but they have also got their hands on and repaired a Lorian airship called Pride, which floats above Armada in a display of pride and power. Their crew and district is called Garwater. They use the flag of Armada as their own.


# The Grand Gears

The Grand Gears are a pirate crew led by the Bookwyrm, a red half-dragon. Their part of the city contains all of the knowledge of Armada, and their inventors and tinkerers work with most of the other crews. They were the ones that created the wave-repellent system. Their flagship is called Pursuit. Their ships fly a flag of three gears spinning each other.

The Grand Gears have been working on magical engineering for a long time, and the Bookwyrm is somewhat annoyed at the fact that it is booming in Anvar thanks to aetherium. Some Grand Gears consider using aetherium too easy and that it is above them, while others don't mind it. In any case, they definitely aren't above smuggling aetherium from the Renvar Isles to [[Armada]] and then selling it or transporting it to markets outside Anvar.


# The Nocturne

The Nocturne was created by Cassius a long time ago to tame the waters, one of the weaknesses of vampires. He was a powerful undead and spellcaster that used blood magic and taught this to others in his crew. Malik became his second-in-command and Ireena his consort, and the crew's power grew. They had some skirmishes with the Garwaters and eventually made peace after they worked together to subdue a royal navy ship and created Armada. Very soon afterwards, Malik and Ireena betrayed Cassius and locked him inside a coffin and threw him into the ocean.

The Nocturne charm potential recruits in a mundane or magical manner. The recruits can then ascend through the ranks by dying and rising as vampire spawn, and then eventually may be allowed to become full vampires. Joining the Nocturne requires relinquishing a great amount of control in exchange for the immortality of undeath. Fully-fledged vampires that have not risen through the ranks are rarely allowed to become trusted members. 

The entire crew offers their blood as tribute to the captain and in return receive superhuman strength, speed and other blessings. Their flagship is called Cruor. They fly a crimson flag the colour of which drains into a goblet, and then turns black.


# The Sealords

The Sealords are a pirate crew that only accepts races native to the sea as its members. Lizardfolk, sea elves, triton, locathah, tortle and other amphibious creatures are welcomed, but landwalkers are shunned. They are led by a triton called Nills, and their flagship is called High Queen of the Ocean.

The Sealords are archetypal pirates but they take advantage of their amphibious nature by attacking ships silently from the sea, without making their presence known. They also have sharks and other sea life as pets that follow their ships and aid them in hunting undersea prey, be it sailors trying to swim away or things of the deep. Nills believes breathing air is a necessary evil but that it corrupts creatures in the long run compared to the purity of the sea.


# The Blackshanks

The Blackshanks are a crew led by Ramsey Poisson, usually simply called the Fox. They are the newest addition to Armada, making their position the most tenuous, but they bring in unparalleled amounts of gold and plunder to the city and are the second most numerous, after the Garwaters. Their flagship is called the Blackfire.

The Blackshanks are the latest addition to Armada and arguably fit in the least. They are the most numerous of the crews and believe in individual freedom above all. Their captain doesn't exactly give them orders while they're in Armada, but on their ships there's a clear chain of command. Their district is a lot of drinking and sex and fistfights, and the Garwaters rarely get involved other than as a show of strength.
