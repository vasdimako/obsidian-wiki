[[Anvar]]

In Illira, the Syndicate's influence spread throughout the continent and is still strong today, with the exception of Anvar: there, the organisation has been compromised and taken over by agents of King Dacane. It is led by the king's spymaster, a halfling called Hammond Garlock.

Mellen is an exception to this: there, the Syndicate has a long-standing working relationship with the baron, who is receiving money to look the other way and has protected them from Hammond Garlock. This is done through the baron's spymaster, who handles all communication between the government and thieves' guild. They have also paid off the dockmaster so that they can smuggle freely and, in fact, be the only ones to do so. They are said to be led by a mysterious individual called Venomshade. Because they are primarily active in the Dust and dock districts, the city guard are discouraged from patrolling these regions by the baron so that the Syndicate can do their thing uninterrupted. The baron is essentially keeping these areas poor despite having the funds to improve the situation there.
