In Illira, the Sidh Mellar established a semblance of a base in Orilon before being ousted when the Emperor and the Solmane declared druidism illegal. They fled to the desert and began to accept and train monks as well as druids and rangers. They are a nomadic order numbering two hundred members at most.
