# Description

[[Fennlor]]

The Eternal Court, or Shae Mordai, are a group of elves that have undergone the Ritual of Undying and become Deathless. The court itself decides whether an elf is worthy of being preserved as one of its number, and only they possess knowledge of how to perform the ritual, created by Varadkar. All members of the court vote equally but the last elf-king, Tuon, presides over discussions.
