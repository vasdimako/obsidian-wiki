The Mercantile Assembly was established by the most influential (that meant the richest) merchants in Haran at the time her independence was declared. It initially had seven members, matching the number of the Enlightened, but this number has since fluctuated based on the number of merchants able to purchase a spot. Joining requires an obscene amount of money donated to the city (a hundred thousand platinum coins), which is exclusively used to improve infrastructure and public services. This is usually accompanied with a generous break in taxes for Haran-based companies for the following month.

The Assembly meet at the Tarasin Hall to decide matters of governance.
