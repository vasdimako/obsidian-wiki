[[Haran]]

The Marshals named themselves so because they strive to always act in accordance to honour and the law, and seek to protect the honour of the Assembly and each and every citizen of Haran. They are city guards that are also empowered to make decisions in disputes of honour between citizens, though Head Marshals are required to adjudicate cases requiring more complex knowledge of the law. They are present all over Haran.
