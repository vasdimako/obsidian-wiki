[[Haran]]

The Syndicate in Haran is still very much active. They have a base of operations beneath the city in Westfall, and are very active in the docks with smuggling and various other business. Minor operations also happen in the East Side, where there are plenty of fat purses to cut. Their leader is Doris Payne, an old human fighter.
