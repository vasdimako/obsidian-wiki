# Description

In all but the most barbaric places, there is currency. A coin, a bill, a gem, a shard of glass, a shell, a letter of credit – the form matters little, but the power that these simple objects possess matters greatly. The Currency Conspiracy is the name often assigned to the hidden actors who work to spread these currencies far and wide throughout all corners of the endless planes, until the final coin rests within the last open hand. Upon that day, they shall awaken to consume the world.

The eldest and most influential among the conspirators are referenced in hushed whispers as the Cabal, and it is their duty to imbue the currencies of the worlds with fragments of the greatest souls stolen, bargained for, taken, and recovered by the Conspiracy. First, they weigh the value of the soul, seeking to judge its level of Gilt. Those who touched the lives of others in powerful ways and shaped the course of history possess much of this power, while those who did nothing of significance are viewed as worthless. Once the judgment is complete, the soul is torn apart and reforged into creatures known as “karensee” or wealth mimics in the common tongue.

# The Agreement

Those who have power and influence are often those most approached by the Conspiracy, both for their ability to further its inscrutable ends and for the potential end value of their soul. However, the famed and wealthy are not the only ones inducted into the ranks of the Conspiracy. Those with talent and skill, unseen by society, are also viewed as valuable. Monsters and loathsome creatures are often inducted into the ranks of the conspiracy, though they are typically considered nothing more than mere collectors and agents. Regardless, the conspiracy approaches in small but remarkable ways: a lucky coin, a discovered gemstone, a few small trinkets that seem to keep turning up again. 

Once taken, the whispers of the Cabal’s endless schemes reach the ears of the subject, and they are brought before this shrouded council for an audience, carried through space and time in an instant. When one arrives, a contract written in blood and arcane ink is presented. One’s soul in exchange for wealth, power, and purpose. Those who sign are inducted, instructed, and returned to their point of departure. Upon leaving the council, all conscious memories of the events that transpired are wiped from the inductee, leaving only the faintest inkling of the deal they made. 

Those who refuse the contract have their memories purged of the event and are returned unharmed to find a bag of currency lying on the ground before them. Most don’t question the missing moments, instead praising their good fortune as they count their newly acquired wealth. Some, however, feel that something is not right and instead begin to question the situation. These are the ones that the Conspiracy seeks to silence, as they tarnish its name.

# Gilt

Those inducted into the Conspiracy are given a single coin of pure Gilt, representing their own soul. It is by this coin that conspirators know and forget one another, for to all but those inducted, the coin is naught but another ordinary denomination. When a conspirator claims the soul of a mortal, through death or thrift, the Conspiracy may fragment the Gilt collected into more karensee. 

Mortal life accumulates Gilt simply by existing, though not all are possessed of great quantities. Gilt is a metaphysical measure of the amount of impact that a person or entity has had upon the world. Those with more Gilt have been more impactful, while those with less are often merely cogs in the great cosmic machine, fulfilling roles simply because they were born to them. Heroes and villains, champions and cruel tyrants alike all possess Gilt in great quantities. 

When Gilt is made to manifest physically by the magic of the Conspiracy, it appears as golden coins that shimmer and sparkle with unseen light, and they are far more burdensome than one might expect from such small objects. 

A dragon’s hoard may be the accumulation of the victims it has slain, the champions it has vanquished, and the beasts that have sworn loyalty to it. It may not truly know the true nature of this coinage, instead merely remarking upon its luck and fortune. A king conquering a new land may find his coffers filled to bursting, the creatures within waiting patiently for their time to rise. Upon that dark and terrible day, the karensee will awaken and feast upon the living in a grand ritual that will send the power of countless souls to the Cabal, making them greater than the gods themselves.

## A Binding Oath

One of the easiest ways for a conspirator to gain Gilt from another creature is to have that being swear an oath of fealty. The creature must speak sincerely, yet does not need to be aware of the full extent of their actions. The oath must contain a declaration of loyalty and a statement of intention to serve. When it is completed, the Gilt from that person flows to the one who is the beneficiary of the oath. 

Members of the Currency Conspiracy who have been initiated in the secrets of Gilt can wield this power and release it into the universe to manipulate magical energies. Once the Gilt has been released, it naturally flows back to the person who swore the oath. Those who have had their Gilt harvested from them by lethal means do not recover their Gilt in the afterlife. Instead, it flows about in the inter-planar spaces, waiting to accumulate around a new mortal soul. Gilt always re-enters circulation, and eventually, even the lowliest soul may bear the Gilt of dead gods from ages past.
