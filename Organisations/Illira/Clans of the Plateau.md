# History

The Shadowmoon clan was the first to hear Azrael's whispers as they looked to the stars. Since then, the four clans have been unified, so it is not uncommon to see individuals from multiple clans working together, but they still retain their identity and live in separate settlements. The newly-established Asarius, City of Beasts, is the exception to this.

# Clans

* Tanglefoot: a druidic clan that uses twisted, cursed plant magic against its foes. The rangers of the Tanglefoot are the best among the beast clans.
* Shattered Hand: A clan that values pain, removing their hands and replacing them with blades. They delight in maiming and hurting others in battle.
* Shadowmoon: A shamanistic clan that once communed with the earth, moon and stars. They now lead the worship of Azrael.
* Bleeding Hollow: named after the hidden chamber in which the chieftains sacrifice an eye to receive a vision of their death. They are a fanatical and crude clan who fight with a berserker fury, slather their weapons in hallucinogenic venom, and stalk prey from the treetops, branding their victims' final moments with visions of pure horror.
