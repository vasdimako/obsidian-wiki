The Herons are a resistance group in Royal Crydee whose goal is to bring down the dragon and restore rulership of the city to the conDoins. Because of Lindgren's oppressive control over the populace, they have been forced to work in extreme secrecy for years and their members number in the low dozens.

They meet in secret in a hidden chamber beneath the Roundtable Mausoleum in Crydee's City of the Dead.

# History

The heron was featured prominently on the conDoin crest. A few months after Lindgren's arrival in Crydee, Borric conDoin's wife Aretha was found to be with child. The duke did not want his child to be born under these conditions, so in his first act of rebellion he gathered a group of loyal individuals and spirited Aretha away from the city. This is how the Herons first came together.

For a long time, the Herons stuck to very small acts of resistance and so did not draw the ire of Lindgren. Five years ago, the dragon disappeared and left Hubert conDoin as a regent in her stead. The Herons have since increased their activity but consequently have angered the regent, who has discovered their existence and made it his goal to destroy them before Lindgren returns.

# Goals

The overall goal of the Herons is to return Crydee to its rightful ruler, Borric conDoin or his heirs. They know about the rings Lindgren uses and know it will be difficult to do so given this fact. Their current goals are:

* They realize Hubert knows of their existence and have decided to murder or kidnap him or otherwise bring him down before the dragon returns.
* To avoid retaliation, they also want to spirit Borric away from the city and to a save haven.
* Their plan is to attack the water treatment plan to alarm the city guard and Preston but not damage it to the point where it hurts the populace. Then, they hope that the increased guard at the plant will allow them to infiltrate the Castle District.
* They have sourced a scroll of Passwall that will allow them to enter the district in the night.
