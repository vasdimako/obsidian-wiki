# Description

The Seer does not look well. His skin is pale and reddish, his eyes sunken and surrounded by bruise-like dark spots. His eyes are reddish-orange, and the whites are yellowing. Much of his body is covered by a thick black cloak, but it is obvious that beneath it is a very sickly, thin man.
