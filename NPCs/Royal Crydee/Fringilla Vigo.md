Fringilla is a young drow with light purple skin and white hair. She is usually dressed in high-necked robes and wears small glasses. Usually very careful and refined with her movement and speech, she is the image of decorum and grace.

> Thatâ€™s the thing about people with secrets, in my experience they never seem to shut up about it.
