## Description
Armada is a floating city made of a hundred ships lashed together. They all have masts and sails that are still functional and can be used to shift the city if absolutely necessary. When Armada is stationary, it uses magitech crystals to alter the weather around it. It can create fog, prevent large waves or even cause a storm to halt any ship's approach. With a combination of magitech and divination, the Grand Gears can locate ships that cross the waters near Armada and send storms or their own fleet against them. Other ships can dock to Armada, with permission, in specially designed areas. Armada is safe enough for members of the five crews, but outsiders are free game unless they're under the protection of one of the captains. Armada's crest, a skull with a pair of crossed scimitars and five stars around it, one for each of the city's districts.

- New arrivals in Armada are taken to docks in the Garwater district, which is very well-kept for consisting entirely of ships. There are also guards from the crew patrolling the streets regularly.
- The Grand Gears district is the smallest, and is by no means residential or tidy. There are no shops or services here, only the Grand Gears library. The streets are lit by magitech lamps and cleaned by magitech roombas - there is evidence of magical technology everywhere.
- The Nocturne's district is enveloped in darkness, covered by a veil of magic that sunlight cannot pierce. It is lit by oil lamps for the sake of non-vampiric crewmembers. The Garwaters patrol this district the least.
- The Sealords' district is only partially above ground to facilitate their business with landwalkers. Most of their dwellings and shops are below ground in ships they have sunk and strapped to Armada.
- The Blackshanks' district is the newest but it is rich and relatively big. It is also the most chaotic, and the Garwaters have trouble keeping the peace. The Blackshanks like to party and spend copious amounts of coin on alcohol and women.


## History

Armada was established when two pirate crews worked together to take over two massive warships and kill everyone on them. They took the cargo but knew not what to do with the ships. They decided to lash the ships together and anchor them in the waters they roamed, as bait and a warning for other sailors. This grisly collection grew as more pirates joined in showing off their trophies into the bustling pirate city it now is.

## Establishments

-   The Grand Gears library is open to the public for a fee, or to allied crews for free. It is a massive library that encompasses ten warships and contains well-organised tomes on tinkering, alchemy and magitech.
-   The Bottle of Rum is a sailing ship converted into a tavern by its owner, Shaddler, who used to be a royal marine captain and retired when his crew was killed by the Garwaters.
