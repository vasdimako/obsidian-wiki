# Backstory

The Twisted Wreath, a maze of knotted and thorny vines, lurks deep within a tangled forest far from any major city. A massive obelisk carved with forgotten druidic runes and brimming with magical energy dominates the center of the maze. Worshipers of various nature deities hold an annual pilgrimage to the obelisk to offer prayers and sacrifices. 

For the last few years, a dryad named Ilkarayda made the Twisted Wreath her home and happily welcomed travelers to worship at the obelisk. 

CHANGE A month ago, a group of clerics traveled to the obelisk and conducted a ritual that sought to bend the magic of the obelisk to their will in an effort to contact a powerful fey lord. To their dismay, the ritual backfired, forcing them to retreat and corrupting the natural world around them. Ilkarayda was killed in the backfire, enraging her bonded vine golem (see Area 6). The golem then attacked and drove off the remaining pilgrims. 

Since then, the Twisted Wreath has turned into a dangerous garden filled with monstrous creatures. The rift created by the failed ritual corrupted the fey, plants, and animals in the Twisted Wreath, turning them aggressive, violent, and evil. A week ago, necrotic power surged out of the rift, transforming the fallen Ilkarayda into a tree skinner (see Area 7) and drawing the attention of a local circle of druids.

# 1 - Entrance

> The forest trail transforms into a passage of thorny vines and hawthorn trees that marks the entrance to the Twisted Wreath. The path ahead is unusually quiet, the typical chirping of insects and bird calls replaced by a daunting silence. 

Several pixies inhabited the Twisted Wreath, caring for it alongside Ilkarayda. When the failed ritual corrupted the maze, the pixies were among the first to succumb to its influence. 

**Creatures.** Two corrupted pixies (Tome of Beasts 2, p. 72) fly invisibly around the entrance, unable to leave the rift’s area of influence but bored and seeking to lure in passersby.

# 2 - Quiet Glade

> The enclosed forest path opens out into a beautiful glade filled with wildflowers and lush grass. 

While tranquil in appearance, this glade is actually the hunting ground for two carnivorous sods (Tome of Beasts 2, p. 57) that lie in wait for unsuspecting travelers. Once ordinary patches of grass, the sods were animated by the failed ritual and are highly aggressive. 

**Treasures.** The bones of several animals and the partial skeleton of a human lie in the glade. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check while inspecting the human discovers it is wearing boots of elvenkind. The skeleton belonged to a human cleric that fell victim to a carnivorous sod shortly after the ritual’s failure.

# 3 - Sickly Tree

The center of this clearing contains a huge, sickly oak tree. A figure sits against the base of the tree, surrounded by blackened leaves and grass. The thorn walls of the clearing look to be frostbitten, though healthy growth has filled in the gaps.

CHANGE [[Shianax]]

# 4 - Abandoned Huts

> This large clearing is filled with several clay huts arranged in a circle around a large obelisk. The huts look to be in various states of disrepair, and most are overgrown with flowering vines and other creeping vegetation. 

These huts were once used by the clerics and druids that came to pray at the obelisk. Each dwelling contains two beds, a table, a small fire pit, a set of wooden shelves, and various everyday utensils. Many of these items are now broken or dirty, and the huts contain nothing of real value. 

**Creatures.** Two bulbous violets (Tome of Beasts 2, p. 53) inhabit the area, originally drawn by the mass death wrought by the failed ritual and the vine golem’s rampage. They consumed all of the bodies over the course of the past month and are growing hungry again. If they sense the PCs, they attack.

# 5 - Obelisk

A massive, rounded, stone obelisk sits on a grassy patch of ground. Weathered, druidic runes cover the obelisk’s smooth, gray surface. A strange pressure radiates from the obelisk, and the air about it shimmers with sparkling dots of light. 

The obelisk is a conduit of raw magical energy that suffuses the area around it. Unfortunately, the rift’s leak of necrotic energy is being enhanced by the obelisk’s influence over the Twisted Wreath, corrupting the fey, animals, and plants within it. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) check while inspecting the obelisk discovers the obelisk’s natural magical nature is spreading nearby necrotic energy like light through a prism. Success on this check also reveals the necrotic energy is coming from the northwest. 

**Magical Conduit.** As an action, a spellcaster touching the obelisk can make a DC 13 spellcasting ability check, using its spellcasting ability modifier. On a success, the spellcaster regains 1 random spent spell slot. On a failure, the spellcaster loses 1 random unexpended spell slot as if it had cast a spell using that spell slot. If the spellcaster fails this check and has no unexpended spell slots, it suffers one level of exhaustion instead. Once a spellcaster has made this check, it can’t do so again until it finishes a long rest.

# 6 - Dryad's Glade

> Αn ancient, withered hawthorn tree sits in the center of this small clearing. A bundle of vines sits among its bare branches. 

Ilkarayda once dwelt in this clearing. Her bonded tree, the hawthorn in the center of the clearing, withered the moment she died to the ritual’s backlash of necrotic power. Her death also severed the bond between herself and her vine golem (Tome of Beasts 2, p. 181). Maddened at the loss of the connection, the vine golem lashed out at the surviving druids and clerics, killing some of them and driving out the rest. 

After rising in her new form, Ilkarayda attempted to soothe the golem, but it failed to recognize her and attacked. Unable to bear the sight of her deceased tree and a second rejection from the golem, Ilkarayda hasn’t returned to this clearing. 

**Creature.** Ilkarayda’s vine golem rests in the branches of her withered hawthorn tree, finding solace in proximity to its former master’s tree. It attacks any creature that enters the clearing. Development. If Ilkarayda is with the PCs when they enter the clearing, a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check halts the golem’s initial assault, though it remains hostile, gesturing for them to leave. If the golem is restrained or a PC succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check, Ilkarayda can take an action to touch the golem and reestablish the link between them, soothing the crazed golem. 

**Treasure.** A small stash of possessions sits in a hollow at the base of the tree. The stash includes 300 cp, 132 sp, 3 tiger eyes worth 10 gp each, a greenstone mug in the shape of a hooting owl worth 50 gp, a bottle of perfume worth 5 gp, a potion of growth, and a spell scroll of dispel magic in a polished mahogany and steel case worth 25 gp.

# 7 - The Corrupted Glade 

CHANGE DESCRIPTION TO SHADOWFELL MERGE, maybe there's a ritualistic vine weapon of the wild clan embedded in space and creating a visible tear, but the space behind it is grey and so on.

> The air in this glade reeks of decaying leaves and dead insects. Brown and wilted grass covers the ground, and the trees along its edges are sickly. A dark smudge of energy swirls in the center of the clearing, and several bodies lie in a loose circle around it. Amidst the black smudge, a wooden dagger is stuck into reality itself. There is dried blood on it, and thorns even on the hilt. Behind it, the ground and trees are black and white and the scenery is most unfamiliar, a dark forest that extends past where the eye can see.

This is the glade where the clerics performed their ritual. While attempting to open up a portal to the realm of the fey, they opened one into the Plane of Shadow instead. The rift sent out a pestilent wave of wild magic and necrotic energy. This wave killed several clerics and most of the plant life in the glade. 

**Creature.** Ilkarayda, now a tree skinner (Tome of Beasts, p. 351), makes her home in this clearing. She understands her presence within trees rots them from the inside out, but the ache of the loss of her tree drives her to rest within them. In an effort to minimize her impact, she alternates the trees she inhabits. Ilkarayda constantly struggles to control the evil inside her, even as she attacks the PCs. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check notices the anguish on her face, and a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check convinces her to stop attacking. Ilkarayda is able to halt her attacks for only 1 minute before the darkness within her forces her to lash out again. During this time, she pleads with them to leave before she loses control. If the PCs destroy the rift, Ilkarayda gains full control of herself and retains her chaotic good alignment, but she remains a tree skinner. 

**The Rift.** The rift in the clearing constantly spews out small amounts of necrotic energy and wild magic. A creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn. A creature that touches the rift takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

**Destroying the Rift.** The rift can be destroyed if it is suffused with enough holy or life magic or if it is dispelled. An effect that turns undead destroys the rift if used within 30 feet of the rift. Dealing 10 radiant damage to the rift destroys it. An entangle, plant growth, spike growth or similar plant growing-related spell cast on the rift destroys it. Alternatively, a successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the rift destroys it. **As the rift closes, a shadowy form approaches from the other side. It is humanoid with a pair of black, leathery wings and a pair of red eyes, burning like coals.**
