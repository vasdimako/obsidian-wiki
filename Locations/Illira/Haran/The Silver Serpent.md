The Silver Serpent is a beautiful, 100ft. long sailing ship. It has a main deck, a lower deck and a hold and seems to carry a few ballistae for defense. It has wyrms, dragons and serpents painted with silver paint on its sides, and its figurehead is a beautiful woman whose lower body is a serpent, and she rests in its coils.

## People

- Captain Brynthar Tiltathana - a drow captain with an ostentatious captain's hat, eyepatch and a big personality, Captain Bryn is always up for joking around and having a good, entertaining conversation. He cares deeply about his crew, and will go to extreme lengths to keep them safe.
- Kronthud Ironfoot - a bookish deep gnome who is the Serpent's boatswain. Kron is fairly talkative with people he's comfortable with, which is mainly the rest of the crew. He's got sharp wits and likes to be sarcastic.
- Airen - a sea elf cleric of Eldath and the sea. Airen is a quiet, strong presence who prefers to listen and offers little input unless called upon. He has a drinking problem.
- Gull - a female half-orc and the first mate. She's pretty loud and funny and hates that she's called Gull - she'd rather not say where her nickname came from.
- Ned - a sort of shifty male human who never looks completely at ease. He's got a quiet way of speaking.
- Garurt - a hench lizardfolk who constantly misuses metaphors and swims at least three times a day.
