# Description

The shoreline near Haran is steep, not a good site for a port. The city itself is built at the delta of a long-dried river, which creates a strip of sea, a thousand feet wide at the mouth, and a few hundred feet of flat land around it. The tip of this strip is the part of the docks reserved for the rich and powerful of the city and, partly on land and partly on wooden platforms above the sea, is where the Small Bazaar is located. From there, it is a short, smooth incline to the South Gate, the main entrance to the city by land. High above the docks is a 100ft. wide arch built of wood that contains shops and other services and is the main thoroughfare for getting between the two sides of Haran. There is a mechanical elevator on each side of the Arch, where one can move from the docks to the main city without the winding trek up the hillsides for a fee.

Marking this entrance is a massive copper statue of a man with three eyes, one on his forehead, and seven arms. A pair of them holds a massive, bright, blue continual flame that shines brightly in the night. This is a statue of Sura, a gift from Elor.

Beyond the docks, steep and narrow roads lead up to the city proper. The eastern district, the [[Upper East Side]], is a few meters taller than the western one - [[Westfall]]. Citizens of each district will argue their side has precisely the perfect height. In both cases, Cliffside properties are the most expensive and prestigious to own. The Tarasin Hall is built on the Arch.


# History

The first settlers of Haran were sent by the Enlightened to establish an Elorian trading base in the north. This was twenty years after the initial human colonization. The city became a centre for commerce and trade between the eastern and western kingdoms, as well as a trading outpost for Elor itself. Eventually, the merchants and companies in Haran sought their independence from Elor and, though relations have remained civil and trade continues, Haran no longer accepts the Enlightened as governors, instead electing to govern themselves through the Mercantile Assembly.

# Culture

Haran is a melting pot of a variety of cultures. Orilonians, Anvari and Elorians have all chosen Haran as their home, seeking a piece of the prospering market. The resulting people are accepting of differences and exotic races but protect their own honour fiercely, often challenging others to duels over trivial disputes. These disputes can also be settled with an exchange of money, if both parties agree on a sum. [[The Marshals]], identified by their green-plumed helmets, handle the legality and resolution of such disputes.


## Religion

As it is a melting pot of people, temples of all sorts of gods can be found in Haran. A Shrine of Sura lies in the Plaza of Light, while there are temples to the [[Church of Symmetry]] and The Solmane in Westside. These are the three largest temples, but there are also smaller shrines to individual lesser gods and a small temple to the Seldarine in the city.
