Westfall is the westernmost district of Anvar, a few feet from the water, built in the more rigid, somewhat gothic style of Anvari architecture. The city's temples are all in this district except for the shrine to Sura. The Church of Symmetry has established a grand temple of the Gods, and a temple to the Solmane lies a few blocks away - not to be outdone. There are also several shrines to every god imaginable tucked away in it.

Though its inhabitants insist being closer to the sea is better for the health and enjoyment of Haran, most of the rich and powerful seem to disagree and keep their homes in the Upper Eastside. That means most of Westfall's residents are working class, often smalltime merchants and shop owners or even servants of richer folk in the Eastside. There are very few large shops here. Mostly, there is only enough to serve the needs of the local residents and temples.


## The Syndicate

The Syndicate's centre of operations in Haran is in Westfall. It can be accessed through the sewers or from within a crypt at the Arboretum, a park and graveyard in the area. A third entrance can be found in the water, below the city.

## Plot Hooks

- A hooded figure shadows the party through Westfall's streets. After being made, the figure disappears into the crowd/in a dark alley. The party can tail them to the Arboretum, where the figure mysteriously disappears into thin air.
- The Solmane temple has had several shipments of expensive ritual components turn up empty, replaced with worthless grain. The clerics think it must be the work of thieves but one, Balnor, thinks the Church of Symmetry's clerics must be sabotaging them. In fact, one of Masic's men is stealing the items for himself, switching out crates when they are delivered.
