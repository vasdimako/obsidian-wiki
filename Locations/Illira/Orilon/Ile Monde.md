Ile Monde is a holy city that covers the entirety of an island on lake Yve, ten kilometers across. It is built around a hill at the top of which lies Solmane Temple, a massive structure of black and white marble that towers over the city. All main roads in Ile Monde lead to this central point, and no buildings are permitted to exceed the height that would block the view of the lake from the temple. Access to the city is possible through two bridges, on opposite sides of the island: the bridge of the Sun and bridge of the Moon. The rest of the buildings in the city are also built of stone in various shades ranging between white and black, leading to an overall appearance that looks like an alternating mosaic. The city is laid out in such a way that the roads radiate outward from the temple at the center, forming the shape of the sun and splitting the circle into ten sectors. The layout of each such sector-district is identical to the city itself - a temple to the remaining ten gods of the Orilonian pantheon lies at the center of each district, and roads radiate out from it.  


# Residents

As a holy city, Ile Monde is ruled by a council led by the Archbishop of Solmane, which also consists of the high priests that rule each district and a representative of the Emperor. The central temple functions as both a holy site and a center for government.
