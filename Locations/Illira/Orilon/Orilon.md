The Orilonian Empire was founded by Reyner de Barad, second heir to the throne of the ancient Loria after the Great Schism. No records exist of the time before the migration other than some noble pedigrees - its causes forgotten in a surprisingly short amount of time. The Emperor wished for Orilon to continue the traditions of his origin and has largely succeeded with multiple aspects of society (like religion).  

In the 130 years since, the Empire has flourished. The current Holy Emperor of Orilon is Francis de Barad II, son of Azor, grandson of Reyner. Blessed by the Lord and Lady and well-liked by the people, he holds absolute power to advance the interests of the Empire at home and abroad.


# Government

## The gentry

The Barad Dynasty has held onto power throughout the Empire's existence and has numerous members, most of which are prepared throughout their early life to take on important positions in government. The rest of the nobles held largely empty titles when the Empire was established, but some raised wealth through commerce and marriage to other wealthy families. Being a noble in itself means little, as most of the land and material wealth that would normally come with the titles was left behind. It can, at the very least, grant audiences with other houses or wealthy commoners and does sometimes come with certain family treasures that were brought along to Illira. 


## Military

All military is controlled by the emperor and his generals. It is organised in Cohorts, each of which serves its own role within the army. The first cohort is the emperor's elite guard.


## Spy Network

The emperor's spy network, sometimes called the thirteenth cohort, is part of the Orilonian military that works in secret to maintain peace and order inside the Empire and protect it from outside threats. It includes a secret police, enforcers that ensure information can be acted on, and a number of spies posted as diplomats and entrepreneurs within and beyond the Great Wall.


## Magic

Spellcasting is heavily regulated. This is done by training individuals with talent in it from a young age and placing them in special regiments of the military. Though this is presented as an honour to these individuals and their families, the separation is forcible. Divine spellcasters whose gifts are suited for war join the twelfth cohort, but the rest are under the service of the church and provide healing and blessings to the people. Arcane spellcasters become part of the fifth, fourteenth or eighteenth cohort depending on their specializations, though some retire to research arcane matters in state-funded universities after some service. Bards learn the ways of channeling magic through performance in the College of Orelle and are scattered between various cohorts to boost morale and provide support. 

A select few are included in the first cohort. Some children whose skills are not immediately obvious grow up to become low-level spellcasters outside the military.
The blessings of Oudin, delivered through her clerics, ensure the prosperity of Orilon's fields and vinyards. The clerics of Artus, on the other hand, ensure nature is respected and allowed to take its course. Druidic magic is frowned upon, as it is seen to be in direct violation of the teachings of Artus and Oudin - to forcibly tamper with nature with anything but divine magic is a grave sin. As a result, there are very few druids in Orilon; they are reclusive, distrustful and tend to stay out of sight.


## Foreign relations

The great wall was built a year after the conquest of Malvern, when King Ernhard Dacane showed no sign of stopping his war. At the same time, emissaries were sent to the villages in the isles to the south and elves to establish a protectorate of the empire with the former, and a strengthen the trade relationship with the latter. Since then, the island communities have flourished while the relationship with the elves has turned into a chilly but seemingly strong alliance.
