Crydee is a large, walled city surrounded by marsh on its south side and plains in the north. The marsh is treeless and flooded, covered by tall grass and bushes, but it gives way to fertile, wet farmland just outside the north city walls. Farther to the north, the arid, rocky landscape of Kaan is visible.

Because of the humid environment, the city was often covered by fog. There are many lights in the streets and roofs to help with navigating. In recent years, the air has become permanently hazy and smells heavily of acrid smoke and chemicals, worse in some areas than others. The combination of the foggy, humid weather and the industrial buildings that have began operating in the city are the cause of the smog.

The city is surrounded by tall stone walls that look fairly strong, if crumbling in places. There are roads in and out of the city from the East, West and North through the Sunrise, Sunset and Wheat gates respectively, and the main thoroughfares are paved with cobblestones. Mud is an issue in the area due to the humidity - side streets and less affluent neighborhoods are impossible to traverse without getting dirty.

# Districts

The roads of Crydee are generally wide and comfortable for multiple people to walk side by side. The main thoroughfares are large enough for horse-drawn carts to make their way through. In general, the city did not lack space and so sprawled outwards, with many cheaper one-story buildings that would not sink into the soft ground. The larger buildings tower over the rooftops, impossible to miss.

- **Castle District:** this district is walled, sharing the southern outer city wall. The conDoins, being a practical and militaristic family, built a proper castle with all the functional trimmings but very little luxury. During [[Lindgren]]'s rulership this has been rectified somewhat - some of the least useful buildings have been demolished, and a small but luxurious home called the Jade Manor has been built in their place.
- **The Waterworks:** The district built around the drainage canal that empties the city sewers into the marsh was the home of the lower classes. This issue was exacerbated when the Waterworks were chosen as the site for the new water treatment plant, a large building of brick and metal with towering chimneys that produce much of the smog that plagues the city. Since the plant began to operate ten years ago, many of the buildings in the district were abandoned by their inhabitants - everyone that could move away did so. The buildings were converted into warehouses, workshops, smaller factories or simply abandoned. The only individuals that live here now are those that have no other choice.
- **Grasmere:** the more affluent neighborhood of Crydee, with many flowering gardens and parks. Trees don't fare very well in the area, but the locals have cultivated beautiful bushes and smaller plants that make this district very green and beautiful. 
- **House of Silver:** this walled complex on the edge of Grasmere began as a monastery for the Order of the Merciful Sword (Tyr) but now also houses Firehair Hall, a temple to Sune, the Monastery of the Silver Soul (dedicated to Selune) and the Tenstones, a circle of stones that serves as an outdoor temple to Silvanus. Other temples also exist in the city outside this compound.
- **Market Square:** consisting of a square and several of the roads leading to it, this bustling district contains most of the shops and businesses of the city. In the square itself, an outdoors market is regularly set up. In recent years, travelling merchants and peddlers tend to avoid Crydee. Many of the businesses are shuttered and only those of use to the locals are still above water.

# Government

Royal Crydee was governed by the duke and the Council of Representatives. The duke maintained command over the armies of the duchy, while the council handled the other aspects of governance. When [[Lindgren]] took over, she took on the role of duke, but has maintained the Council.
