Kaanthus lies in a basin surrounded on all sides by steep cliffs. Whether a result of its emergence from belowgrounds or its initial position, the city is now fairly hard to get to. The main entrance is a staircase that has been carved into the rock on the southwest, but there is also a river that was formed when the city emerged. It begins at an oasis on the northeast and flows into the city, flowing through some of it before pouring into a deep rift filled with molten lava. 

A large palace stands at the edge of this rift, the center of Kaanthus and grandest temple to [[The Pale One]]. Snake-faced gargoyles perch at the edge of the cliff every fifty feet or so, staring down at it. At the top of the staircase, a large number of tents appears to have been set up - these are the camps of the LARPers, Orilonians and Anvari soldiers that have arrived at Kaanthus.  The city below has brought some of the flora and fauna of the depths below up with it: moss, sometimes fluorescent, covers the walls, and glowing mushrooms of various sizes grow between and inside buildings.   


## Inhabitants   

The Kaanthi are a deeply religious people. Their defacto leader is the high cleric of the Lord of Blood - the current one being [[Ras Nsi]]. However, the beliefs of a faction called the Flayed have begun to spread across the Kaanthi people and find purchase in many. Their leader, [[Talesh]], believes power must be taken forcibly and assimilated within the Kaanthi's bodies to restore the great injustice committed to the Pale One. It was the Flayed that campaigned for Kaanthus to return to the surface and Ras Nsi, though initially reluctant, has agreed.  Kaanthus is home to the Nine Shrines, holy sites created by the first nine clerics of the Pale One (one of whom was Shagambi, Rafela). 

These contain challenges meant to test would-be champions of the Pale One and successfully retrieving the nine cubes contained within is a prerequisite for attempting to draw the blade. Many have completed the trials over the years, with [[Rahvin]] being the first, but none have successfully freed the Lord. For that reason, the Flayed consider this a tradition that should be abolished. Unbeknownst to them, however, their leader, Talesh, has in fact completed the trials.
