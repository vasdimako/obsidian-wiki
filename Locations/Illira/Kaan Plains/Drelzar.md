Drelzar is quite ancient, though very little remains from the original city. Its current buildings are built of a combination of mud and brown brick hewn from the nearby stones, scattered around the main thoroughfare and around a large, reddish-yellow tiered pyramid. This used to be a Kaanthi settlement but it was abandoned and left to the elements before it was repurposed by the traders out of Haran.

After Kaanthus reemerged, trade in the area has slowed down as traders feel unsafe by the Kaanthi's presence. Many of the buildings look shuttered, permanently or temporarily.

## Locations

- Temple of the Sun: this ancient temple has been repurposed to worship the Just Lord, the Burning Sun, Yvo as well as the Anvari deities of the Light domain, [[Helm]] and [[Sune]]. It is a tiered pyramid built of reddish stone. Some snake-like imagery can still be found at the temple, suggesting its origin. The lone cleric here is an Orilonian called Komit.
- The Golden Palm: a low building, painted white, opens onto the street. A pair of large palms grows on either side of its entrance, arching over the door. Parts of the wall look ancient, but it has been built over. The owner, Tekuna Chand, is a retired adventurer who is still in excellent shape. She servers good wine, food and shelter to all who have coin for it without discrimination.
