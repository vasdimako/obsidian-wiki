## History

This was once a temple to Labellas Enoreth, built amid the sands of Kaan as a symbol. The temple was attacked by Kaanthi whilst the arcanist [[Varadkar]] and his mate, [[Finwe]], visited in pilgrimage. Finwe was slain in the ensuing battle and Varadkar, in his rage, defaced the temple and vowed to find a way to stop the passage of time from the elves and achieve immortality. The temple was turned into Finwe's grave.
