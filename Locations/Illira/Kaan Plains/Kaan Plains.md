The region has suffered devastating tectonic shifts due to the moving of [[Kaanthus]].
## Landmarks

-   The faraway shrine
-   The caravansary and nearby bandits
-   Ravi, a desert druid who knows the [[Sidh Mellar]] - she only has one arm and keeps a garden of fungi and succulents in an oasis of her own make. Her oasis around Firefinger has been taken over by an evil Nagpa and its summoned pterafolk.

## Travel

Characters who explore Kaan need plenty of water to stay hydrated. The water found in rivers and on the ground is unfit for drinking unless it is boiled first. At the end of each day, any character who hasn't drunk at least 2 gallons of fresh water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1 level of exhaustion. The saving throw is made with disadvantage if the character is wearing medium armor, heavy armor, or heavy clothing. Characters traveling at a fast pace, instead of a normal or slow pace, take a -5 penalty on their saving throws against dehydration.
