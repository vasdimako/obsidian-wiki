The Kraken’s Head is a modest inn in the middle district of [[Haran]]. It is an affordable inn, with tasty homemade foods and a calm atmosphere. If you are a customer, you know that part of the price is the calming atmosphere, so there are not a lot of rowdy customers. Most customers are either alone, working or with a small company that almost whisper to each other.

It is made from dark wood and the inn’s symbol is a submerged kraken, with two tentacles joining the chains where the symbol is hang. The interior of the inn is always dimly lit, with small candles on every table, and the atmosphere is always calm and cozy. A huge stone fireplace always burns, and during the times when there are no performances, the crackling of the fire is almost magically enhanced to add to the aesthetic of the place.

Most of the performers of the inn follow the low energy of the place. Melancholic melodies, instrumental concertos or tear jerking ballads are the performances you are most likely to witness there. Due to the unique melancholic aesthetic of the place, there are normally a good amount of customers, but the place is never full, which makes people wonder how the business continues to thrive.

The rooms follow the same rules. They are filled with the necessary furniture, dark in colour and quite comfortable. There are not a lot of rooms the inn offers, as most of them are occupied by the owner and the performers.

Since the inn is rather expensive and it never causes any trouble with rowdy tavern fights, the guards rarely pay it a visit. As such, it has become a favorable spot for people that don’t want to draw any attention and are willing to pay more for that.
