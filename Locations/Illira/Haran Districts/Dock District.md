The dock district of [[Haran]] is a bustling place day and night, with ships coming and going constantly. The outskirts of the docks are home to the fishermen and captains of smaller ships, while richer merchants unload their wares closer to the bazaar, further inland. Spots beneath the arch are reserved for the Assembly.

## The Small Bazaar

The small bazaar is by no means small - it is simply named such so that it doesn't infringe on the Grand Bazaar of Elor. It stretches around the central, uphill road from the docks' tip to the city gate, a good half-mile long and at least as wide. There is a huge number of shops here, some more permanent than others, and the variety of goods available is rivalled only by the Grand Bazaar itself.

Some of the main thoroughfares are paved, mostly around the permanent shops. Sellers of wares of dubious legality set up shop in the smaller alleyways and passages between the other shops. Street musicians, bands, dancers, magicians and food-sellers take advantage of the heavy foot traffic to make coin, giving the bazaar a unique blend of smells and sounds. It would take a visitor many days to visit every shop in the Bazaar and, by the time they finished, dozens more will have sprung up.

Roughly in the middle of the Bazaar lies an open space, the Plaza of Light, where the Enlightened are said to have placed the first stone when Haran was established. A massive monolith towers ten meters tall in the very middle, with the holy symbol of Sura and the names of the Seven at the time of Haran's founding below it.
