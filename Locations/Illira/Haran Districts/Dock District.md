The dock district of [[Haran]] is a bustling place day and night, with ships coming and going constantly. The outskirts of the docks are home to the fishermen and captains of smaller ships, while richer merchants unload their wares closer to the bazaar, further inland. Spots beneath the arch are reserved for the Assembly.

## The Small Bazaar

The small bazaar is by no means small - it is simply named such so that it doesn't infringe on the Grand Bazaar of Elor. It stretches around the central, uphill road from the docks' tip to the city gate, a good half-mile long and at least as wide. There is a huge number of shops here, some more permanent than others, and the variety of goods available is rivalled only by the Grand Bazaar itself.

Some of the main thoroughfares are paved, mostly around the permanent shops. Sellers of wares of dubious legality set up shop in the smaller alleyways and passages between the other shops. Street musicians, bands, dancers, magicians and food-sellers take advantage of the heavy foot traffic to make coin, giving the bazaar a unique blend of smells and sounds. It would take a visitor many days to visit every shop in the Bazaar and, by the time they finished, dozens more will have sprung up.

Roughly in the middle of the Bazaar lies an open space, the Plaza of Light, where the Enlightened are said to have placed the first stone when Haran was established. A massive monolith towers ten meters tall in the very middle, with the holy symbol of Sura and the names of the Seven at the time of Haran's founding below it.

## Unique Shops

-   **A Sailor's Dream:** a shop owned by a weasely old man who's missing an arm that has all sorts of sailing paraphernalia: cutlasses, hats, knockoff uniforms, but also some more interesting items: cursed bullets that give a -5 modifier to any given attack and make the weapon explode if a 0 is rolled, or a cane with a mermaid handle that can be pulled out to reveal a rapier. There is also an old, ragged treasure map. The man's pride and joy is his bottle of endless rum that only dries out when the drinker is in danger, but he won't part with it unless offered a very large sum.
-   **Piercing Shop:** a piercing is straightforward enough to do, but this shop sells earrings that whisper translations of specific languages in the wearer's ears.
-   **Tattoo Shop:** a female fire genasi with dreadlocks and a warm smile, Reeva is an expert in tattoos. She also knows how to infuse the raw power of gemstones into tattoos. She requires 4000 gold worth of gemstones that she can use to create the following tattoos: +1STR (ruby), +1DEX (emerald), +1CON (diamond), +1WIS (jade), +1INT (sapphire), +1CHA (aquamarine).
-   **Gnome's Curiosities:** a male gnome tinkerer who's very excited about his wares. He sells inventions of dubious reliability (all of them have a cumulative 10% chance of failing every time they are used, and then require 10g of materials and a DC10 Tinker's Tools checks to function again). He sells guns, mechanical pets (most of the prototypes are squirrels, but a couple of dogs as well), "I Can't Believe It's Not Holy Water" branded holy water, gloves covered in tiny hooks to make climbing easier, boots that aid jumping by shooting out bursts of air, a bottle of really powerful lubricant (casts grease when thrown), bouncing caltrops (like caltrops but DC20), Jim (a clockwork human that walks around and brags about how tall he is and how much he likes fighting with swords), a light-up board that displays how many days it's been since your last accident and his pride and joy, the Fetcher 9000: a clockwork beetle that goes to find whatever its master asks (functions for two hours).
-   **The Stranded Goose:** the Bazaar's one inn lies in the intersection of four major throughways. There are a lot of tables on the pavement outside it, and they tend to be very full. Rooms are let upstairs for a reasonable amount. The inn is owned by a cheerful firbolg called Julian and his very large, white goose Miranda who frequently walks around tables and into bedrooms, inspecting the clientele. Surprisingly, she is not aggressive.
-   **The Wondrous Menagerie:** a rare creatures shop owned by a very chill tortle elder called Shelly. Wares include a tressym, an octopus that can breathe air, a thick green caterpillar, a chameleon, a pigmy sheep, a blink dog, a pseudodragon.

There are also all sorts of random stalls selling potions, scrolls, trinkets (all rolled randomly every day), gems, armor, shields, a range of different clothes for different price tags and tastes, spell components, fresh fruit, nuts, cheese, perfumes, miniature Assembly member ships, travel equipment, coffee and tea. Alcohol is also sold in copious amounts in the afternoon, with merchants hauling portable stalls with barrels of beer, wine, rum and other, rarer beverages.

## Plot Hooks

-   Upon purchasing a normal mundane item, it is found to be hollow, with an unknown substance hidden inside of it. If left undiscovered, the person who sold it will try to get the item back, by negotiation or violence, it depends on the party's willingness to part with it.
-   A certain type of plush toy is all the rage in this city, and the party will acquire one upon their next purchase - all the merchants were paid to distribute these as "customer incentives." The toys act as scrying focus for the local [[Organisations/Illira/Anvar/The Syndicate|Syndicate]] branch. The party's lodgings will be robbed within 24 hours obtaining the toy.
-   A small purse keeps whispering at a player for them to buy it. It remains silent when others are observing it and refuses to talk if it thinks anyone else can hear it. It says it can help them (count money, hide it from pickpockets, and offer insight) if they give it something in return (it wants costly gemstones).
-   A street corner storyteller is spinning a tale of adventure and peril to a crowd. The tale sounds suspiciously like the last adventure the party had.
-   A stealthy, clever player investigating the docks might notice Masic's workers unloading some shady cargo in the night.
