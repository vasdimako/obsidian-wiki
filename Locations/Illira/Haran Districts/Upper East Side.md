The Upper East Side is a place of decadence, music and laughter where the rich and poor of Haran know they will find a good time within their means. Street dancers and musicians can be found at nearly every corner, with the occasional magician and acrobat as well. The buildings here are colourful and spacious, in a mix of the architecture found in Elor and Orilon, with large gardens and parks taking up much of the district.

The Dancing Dryad



## Plot Hooks

- A masked spruiker hands the party an ornately engraved thin metal plaque inviting them to an exclusive event at a place called "The Secret Garden", and a map is etched on the reverse side. The event, if attended, presents the party with an opportunity to travel to another plane and earn the favor of a powerful, if enigmatic figure. There also may be evidence of the tadpoles or "the Kiss" there.
- A dance troupe, known for their public and surprise appearances (a "flashmob"), starts a performance in and around the party in the street. During the performance one of the dancers lunges at one of the party members and whispers, "Help me" in their ear, before carrying on with the spectacle.
