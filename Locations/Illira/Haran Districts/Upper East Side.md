The Upper East Side is a place of decadence, music and laughter where the rich and poor of Haran know they will find a good time within their means. Street dancers and musicians can be found at nearly every corner, with the occasional magician and acrobat as well. The buildings here are colourful and spacious, in a mix of the architecture found in Elor and Orilon, with large gardens and parks taking up much of the district.
