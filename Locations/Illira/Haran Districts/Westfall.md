Westfall is the westernmost district of Anvar, a few feet from the water, built in the more rigid, somewhat gothic style of Anvari architecture. The city's temples are all in this district except for the shrine to Sura. The Church of Symmetry has established a grand temple of the Gods, and a temple to the Solmane lies a few blocks away - not to be outdone. There are also several shrines to every god imaginable tucked away in it.

Though its inhabitants insist being closer to the sea is better for the health and enjoyment of Haran, most of the rich and powerful seem to disagree and keep their homes in the Upper Eastside. That means most of Westfall's residents are working class, often smalltime merchants and shop owners or even servants of richer folk in the Eastside. There are very few large shops here. Mostly, there is only enough to serve the needs of the local residents and temples.
