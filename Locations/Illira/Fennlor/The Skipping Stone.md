“Skipping Stone” is an inconspicuous riverboat owned by Ellas Elendiir. She travels along Anor, where she smuggles goods and occasionally people in and out of Fennlor. Dawn is able to navigate through the Shadow Fold, or “Dae Dagor” in elvish, using the spirits’ guidance. There are things that stir inside Dae Dagor but Skipping Stone has been lucky enough to avoid them. On her last journey, the crew was tasked to smuggle a small humanoid out of Fennlor. However, when the boat was almost at the edge of the fold, explosions started in the water under the hull, and Dawn saw a flying ship on top of them right before she passed out.
