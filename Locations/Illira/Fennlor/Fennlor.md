# Fennlor Overview
  
## History

The elves of Fennlor have lived in [[Illira]] from the dawn of memory. Their settlements once spanned the entire continent, but infighting, natural calamities and emerging threats reduced the size of the elves' domain to only the enchanted forest of Fennlor, in the middle of the continent. The time of elven glory, when Fennlor extended beyond the forest is remembered only in song and in memories before the Drawing of the Veil. Five centuries ago, the elves' realm shrunk even further when the western part of Fennlor across the Anor river, Greenhome, began to twist and darken, and the elves fled east. This coincided with the loss of the Faestone from its sacred temple in [[Ryanora]]. Grief at the loss of the Stone is still fresh in the hearts of elves throughout Fennlor. 

The western part of the forest's decline was quick - soon, it was no longer the lush green elfhome but a Black Marsh. Most believe the loss of the Faestone was what allowed dark powers to corrupt the forest, but some think the loss of Greenhome and the Stone are both punishments by [[The Seldarine]], who have reclaimed their gifts as punishment for some unknown slight.

Still, throughout time, what is now left of the forest of Fennlor has always been the center of Illiran elven civilization. Here lies the Crystal Palace (Maril'turion) and Crystal Throne (Maril'tarhanwa), whence the elf-kings ruled from. A great change has taken place in [[Lathelond]] in recent years, and no king sits at the Crystal Throne any longer. Instead, [[the Eternal Court]] rules over Fennlor with their infinite wisdom preserved through time. 

Calls to institute the Court first emerged four centuries ago, when the wizard [[Varadkar]] revealed he had devised a costly but effective method to preserve souls. It was collectively decided by the elves to reserve this method for glorious souls and minds that deserved preservation, and to use the wisdom of those preserved for the good of Fennlor. The elf-king at the time, Tuon, was the first to undertake this process and the Court was formed with his blessing and himself as first member.

## Government

### The Eternal Court
[[The Eternal Court]], or Shae Mordai, are a group of elves that have undergone the Ritual of Undying and become Deathless. The court itself decides whether an elf is worthy of being preserved as one of its number, and only they possess knowledge of how to perform the ritual, created by [[Varadkar]]. All members of the court vote equally but the last elf-king, Tuon, presides over discussions.


### Quendi

Though the Court steers the elven people as a whole, day to day governance is still left to the local Quendir, or Speaker, who may come to the Council for advise if they so require.


### Nammar an Varne

The Protectors of the Court are an organisation established by [[Varadkar]] to help ensure the survival of the ages of wisdom of the Undying Court.
