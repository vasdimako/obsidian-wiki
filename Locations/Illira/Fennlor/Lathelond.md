The forest around Lathelond is ancient and infused by elven magic, with trees growing many times larger than normal becoming increasingly often as one approaches the city. Lathelond is divided into two sections, Northbank and Southbank, with the river Lathanor running between them. It is surrounded by a beautiful and strange wall that looks to be weaved out of tree roots and branches, with stone walls peeking between them. Every so often, a watchtower in the form of an ancient tree splits the wall. A large area known as the Market divides Northbank west and east, from the wall to the Riverside. Southbank is where the Crystal Palace is located. It once was open to the public, with large plazas, magical parks and gardens for all to enjoy. The balance of the magic keeping [[the Eternal Court]] alive is fragile, however, and Southbank is now off-limits to any that haven't explicitly been invited there.
