# Description

From the outside, the tower looks like a tall but fairly small structure with small arched windows. Its wooden double door is at least a story tall and covered from top to bottom with arcane runes and script. The only telltale sign of its magical nature is the arcane clouds that cover its top and sometimes extend further down. Inside, the tower is several times larger than it should be (it is an elaborate demiplane).

The building itself is infused with magic, and magic is very much a part of its daily function. Its corridors are lit by ever-burning candles in holders or floating on air, and its fireplaces can be turned on and off with a simple gesture, its library reorganizes itself, its kitchens are manned by permanently bound unseen servants.

When it comes to layout, the ground floor is a large welcome room where busy secretaries sit at their desks. A long, curved staircase starts at the right and leads up to the first floor, which contains auditoriums and classrooms. 

The second floor houses the students' quarters and study rooms, while the third and fourth floors are entirely taken up by a seemingly endless library; the third contains books on every mundane subject imaginable, while the fourth houses an extensive collection of tomes exclusively on magical topics. 

The fifth and sixth floors contain the wizards' rooms and laboratories, as well as specially warded rooms for dangerous magic. The seventh floor houses the quarters of the archmage and eight school heads, and their personal laboratories. 

On the eighth floor lie teleportation circles linked to most major settlements in Anvar, Haran and one to the capital of Fennlor. These do not require spell slots to be activated, but can only be used with special keys in the form of magical bracelets with a golden key charm held only by the most trusted members of the Institute.

Below ground level lie the Institute's cellars and storage rooms, as well as a heavily guarded (arcane golems) and warded room housing the resident beholder whose magic is being siphoned to maintain the Institute's demiplane.


# History

The Rawcliffe Institute was established by an already tight-knit group of wizards that came to Illira during the colonization, who began to build the tower shortly after. The village grew around it to serve the growing needs of the Institute. The town is based on providing trade and services to the tower itself but produces enough food to sustain itself through farming, hunting and fishing. At the behest of King Ernhard, the town itself is governed by a mayor who is independent to the Institute. The current holder of this position is a half-elf called Rayna Hect.


# The Council of Eight

Rawcliffe is led by the Council of Eight, which consists of eight archmages each with a specialisation in subject and school of magic. The court wizards of each duchy are also invited to participate. The School of Necromancy is not officially represented in this council. Its members are:
