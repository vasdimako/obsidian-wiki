## Government

The nobles of Anvar usually also hold a portion of land that they rule over on behalf of the king, a feudal system. The kingdom is split into duchies, and the duke that rules over each of them on behalf of the king has final word on matters of governance. These duchies and their leaders are:


* Castath: the duchy of Castath is ruled by the king of Anvar, his advisors and his descendants. It was initially ruled by the Dacane family, but they were stripped of their nobility and land when [[Ernhard Dacane]] was removed from the throne. It is now in the hands of Queen [[Ralena Sinclair]].
* Whitehaven: the duchy of Whitehaven was granted to the Ramsworth family after the war. Duke Darryl Ramsworth ruled there since the war but recently stepped down. His second oldest child, [[Evelyn Ramsworth]], now rules, but she has been asked by the Queen to allow Prince Eomund to assist her.
* Highmountain: House Rothgard has ruled Highmountain since its establishment. The current ruler is Walter Rothgard.
* Nirn: House Blackmoor rule Nirn.
* Crydee:
* Mellen:
