A small village on the edge of the swamp, Blackmarsh suffers from terrible humidity and an annoying number of insects. From afar, the village has a greenish hue in the night thanks to the cheap aetherium lanterns used to light it. Despite homes being built on raised platforms, Blackmarsh is slowly sinking into the swamp. Still, Blackmarsh being on the edge of civilization means a large number of travelers make a stop at its inn, a magnificent building of stone and wood beams. Beyond trade and hospitality, the locals make a living out of the swamp itself, hunting strange animals and plants for sale to faraway places.

# History
Blackmarsh is far enough away from most happenings that it has not been affected by any of the recent wars. Even Azrael's ascendance left the village largely undisturbed. In the years since then, however, the nearby swamp has grown darker and more dangerous. Rangers from Crydee pass through the village often, on their way to explore some part of the swamp and quell any threats there.

# Residents
- [[mayor_quentin.jpg|Mayor Quentin]]: he has been mayor ever since he came back to the village a fairly successful merchant. A rotund man with ginger whiskers.
- [[Evan Mayhew]]: a mysterious adventurer, friend of the mayor's who bought an abandoned house and has been fixing it up since then. None of the villagers know why the dashing stranger decided to come to Blackmarsh, but speculation is rife.
- [[valeriana.jpg|Valeriana]]: an old trader. She has a lot of foreign friends and has retired to the village but continues exchanging goods and maintaining those relationships. She wears a holy symbol of [[Helm]].
- [[argon.jpg|Argon]]: A stout half-orc who boasts about his accomplishments as an adventurer and proudly displays his war axe on an ebony plaque behind the bar. He challenges adventurers to take the bigger jobs and bigger hunts if he hears them deliberating in his tavern. He was injured badly in his last adventure and decided only then to retire, though it is clear he misses the life. He pays nobly for a good stag or boar and is known to post hunts of unusual creatures that plague the area.
- [[adrian_aderre.jpg|Adrian Aderre]]: The mayor's knight and unofficial sheriff and enforcer for Blackmarsh. He is originally Orilonian, as can be seen by the holy symbol of Yvo hanging from his neck and the faded Empire crest on his shield.

# Plot Hooks
-  There is a wise man living in the swamp. He can offer wisdom and many spells and concoctions that help to traverse the swamp. Valeriana actually has a bundle that needs to be delivered to him. (The Twisted Wreath, Tome of Beasts 2, Lairs/The Sunken Library of Qezzit Quire)
- Tome of Beasts 2, Lairs, The River Tomb: there is a tomb that's recently been uncovered in the swampland. Argon sent a group of adventurers there some time ago, but they haven't returned. He's concerned because some kind of water elemental attacked the rangers when they tried to investigate it, suggesting some kind of magic at play.
