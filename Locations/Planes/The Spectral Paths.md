A collection of mystical, marble walkways, bridges and stairs that connect islands suspended in darkness. Stone doors lie upon some of these islands, and the islands themselves seem to mirror what lies on the other side. On the rest of the islands there are large stones that once held directions for navigating this realm. The laws of physics do not entirely hold sway on this plane, as is evident by the positions of the paths themselves as well as the behaviour of light: it does not reach as far as in the Material Plane, and seems to have an ever-changing hue of different colours. The Paths are absolutely silent, and sounds made by those travelling in them seem amplified. There are no signs of life in the form of plants or animals; only stone paths that appear to be slowly eaten away by some kind of erosion.

## Known Exits


-   Colmar, Orilon
-   Morne, Loria

## Dangers

Some of the bridges and walkways in this realm have been worn to the point of collapsing, or being near collapse. It is possible that one can't get to their destination because of that, or even being on a section as it collapses. Additionally, the waystones that once presumably helped travelers to their destination are worn to the point of being smooth.

The only denizen of this plane is the Shadow Wind, a vast chaotic creature that seeks to devour all life but is confined to the Paths. Using magic draws the attention of the Wind, which manifests first as a light breeze and quickly grows to a merciless lashing. In the presence of this wind, players must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC10) every 10 minutes or take 1d6 psychic damage.
