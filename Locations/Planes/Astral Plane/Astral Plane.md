# Description

The **Astral Plane** is, quite literally, the plane of stars. More precisely, it is where the stars and portals to the heavens resideâ€”an infinitely vast celestial void that surrounds and connects every plane of every world.

The Material Plane is surrounded by an airless void known as the **[[Wildspace]]**. Other than the twelve moons of Atus, no other notable or named celestial bodies exist in this Wildspace system. Uniquely, the Wildspace is both a part of the Material and Astral Plane, and creatures exist simultaneously in both. Creatures and objects in Wildspace age normally and are effectively on both of those planes at once. 

If you were to leave your home world and continue outward until you neared the edge of the Wildspace, you would begin to see a faint, silvery haze. By traveling into this haze, you pass from Wildspace into the **[[Astral Sea]]**, more colorfully known as the Silver Void. The deeper into the Astral Sea you travel, the thicker and brighter the haze becomes, but the stars that shine through it are always visible. Wildspace and the Astral Sea together comprise the Astral Plane.

The Astral Sea surrounds the Wildspace and connects it to the other Planes. It also may potentially connect to other Wildspaces.
