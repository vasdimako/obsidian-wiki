# Spelljamming

Rules for spelljamming and objects in space more generally are provided below.

## Speed

When cruising through space, a spelljamming ship can travel 100 million miles in 24 hours. At this speed, the spelljamming helm makes minor course corrections on its own to avoid collisions with meteorites, other detritus, and space-dwelling creatures. These slight course corrections sometimes cause mild space sickness, which is a harmless affliction common among those who aren't accustomed to space travel.

A spelljamming ship automatically slows to its flying speed when it comes close to something big enough to have its own air envelope and gravity plane, such as another ship, a kindori, an asteroid, or a planet. The exact distance between the obstacle and the ship is for the DM to decide, but whatever obstacle caused the ship to slow down is usually close enough to be seen by creatures on deck. While moving at its flying speed, a spelljamming ship is generally as maneuverable as a seafaring vessel of a similar size.

## Sensations

Using a spelljamming helm to move a ship produces a feeling in the spelljammer similar to moving a limb that has fallen asleep—a pins-and-needles sensation, though not as painful as its analog. When the ship approaches something large in space, the spelljammer is usually the first to detect it as the ship slows down. An experienced spelljammer can often sense what caused the ship to slow down a few moments before it can be seen; an asteroid "feels" different from a space galleon or a pod of kindori, for example.

## Spelljammer Duels

A ship can have more than one spelljamming helm aboard it, but only one spelljamming helm at a time can be used to control the ship. If a spelljammer tries to gain control of a ship by using a second spelljamming helm, a spelljammer duel ensues. Resolve this conflict by having each spelljammer make a Constitution check; if the dueling spelljammers tie, have them reroll. The spelljammer with the lowest check result loses the duel and gains 1d4 levels of exhaustion; in addition, their attunement to their spelljamming helm ends at once, and they can't attune to any spelljamming helm until all levels of exhaustion are removed from them.

# Air Envelopes

When a creature or an object leaves a planet's atmosphere and enters Wildspace, an envelope of breathable air forms around it and lasts until that air is depleted.

## Air Envelopes of Creatures

The envelope of breathable air that forms around a creature takes the shape of a cube centered on that creature. The creature's size determines the cube's dimensions, as shown in the Air Envelopes of Creatures table.

| Creature's Size | Air Envelope |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Tiny            | 2½-foot cube |
| Small or Medium | 5-foot cube  |
| Large           | 10-foot cube |
| Huge            | 15-foot cube |
| Gargantuan      | 20-foot cube |

A creature that needs to breathe will exhaust the air in its personal envelope in 1 minute. Since this is barely enough time to get anywhere, most creatures travel through Wildspace aboard spelljamming ships, which have much larger air envelopes.

## Air Envelopes of Objects

The envelope of breathable air that forms around an object extends out from its surface a distance equal to the longest dimension of its form. For example, a spherical planet 5,000 miles in diameter has an air envelope 15,000 miles in diameter, with the planet at the center of it. An air envelope need not be spherical; for example, a block of wood 1 foot by 2 feet by 3 feet is surrounded by a more-or-less rectangular envelope of air 3 feet by 6 feet by 9 feet.  The air envelope around a spelljamming ship typically has an ovoid shape. The air envelope around a habitable planet or moon is called an atmosphere. An atmosphere is a special kind of air envelope that replenishes itself constantly. A creature or an object can refresh its air envelope by entering the atmosphere of a planet or moon.

## Air Quality

The air envelope around a body or ship can be fresh, foul, or deadly. Air can change from one quality to another over time. 

**Fresh air** is completely breathable. Under normal circumstances, the air envelope of a ship remains fresh for 120 days. If a ship carries more creatures than its normal crew complement, they exhaust the supply of fresh air more quickly.  

**Foul air** is stale and partially depleted. It is humid and smells bad. Any creature that breathes foul air becomes poisoned until it breathes fresh air again. The air aboard a ship with a normal crew complement degrades from fresh to foul on day 121, and the foul air turns deadly 120 days later.  

**Deadly air** is unbreathable. Any creature that tries to breathe deadly air begins to suffocate.

###Overlapping Air Envelopes

When two bodies come close enough to each other, their air envelopes merge, and the quality of the air around the smaller body changes to match that of the larger body. When the bodies later move away from each other, each one reclaims and retains its own air envelope.  

For example, if a damselfly ship with a foul air envelope enters the atmosphere a planet with fresh air, the two air envelopes merge, and the damselfly ship's air quality changes from foul to fresh. If that ship then merges its fresh air envelope with the deadly air envelope surrounding a derelict ship, the damselfly ship's air quality would change from fresh to deadly.

# Gravity Planes

The reason everything pulls its own atmosphere along through space is the force of gravity. It's also the reason why creatures can stand on a spacefaring ship without falling off the deck.  

In Wildspace and on the Astral Plane, gravity is an accommodating force, in that the direction of its effect seems to be "that which is most convenient." For an object the size of a planet or moon, gravity pulls everything toward the center of the body, meaning that creatures can stand upright anywhere on the surface, and dropped objects fall perpendicular to the surface they land on.  

For smaller objects, such as spacecraft, gravity doesn't radiate from a point but rather from a plane that cuts horizontally through the object and extends out as far as its air envelope. An object's gravity plane is two-directional: a creature can stand upright on the bottom of a ship's hull—upside down from the perspective of those elsewhere on the ship—and move around as easily as if it were walking on the top deck.

One of the unusual properties of a gravity plane is that an object that falls off the side of a ship can end up oscillating back and forth across the gravity plane. It drops in one direction until it crosses the plane, then reverses direction back toward the plane again, continuing until something causes it to stop.

## Overlapping Gravity Planes

When gravity planes intersect, such as when two ships pass close to each other and at different angles, the gravity planes of both ships remain in effect until the two ships touch one other (as often happens when they collide or when one ship lands on the other). If that happens, the gravity plane of the ship that has more hit points remaining (regardless of the ships' actual dimensions) overrides the other ship's gravity plane, suppressing it as long as the ships remain in contact, and the first ship's definition of "up" becomes the other ship's as well.  

When a ship touches down on a planet (or some other enormous body), the ship's gravity plane is suppressed. If a ship has one or more decks on the ventral side of the ship's gravity plane (rather than its dorsal side), precautions must be taken before the ship lands to secure anyone and anything that might fall when the ship's gravity plane is suppressed.

## Drifting

When a spelljamming ship moves in space, creatures and objects in its air envelope move with it, pulled along with the ship because of the strength of its gravity plane.  

However, an unanchored creature or object floating in a ship's air envelope is weightless and drifts toward the edge of the air envelope at a speed of 10 feet per minute. For example, an unconscious sailor or a crate that falls off the deck of a spelljamming ship would begin drifting away from the ship along its gravity plane toward the edge of the ship's air envelope. When it exits the air envelope, the sailor or the crate would be left behind as the ship moves away from it.

## Falling

A floating creature that enters the air envelope of a larger body is immediately affected by the larger body's gravity (such as that of a planet) or gravity plane (such as that of a spelljamming ship). The creature falls from where it entered the air envelope to the surface of that body, or to the gravity plane of that body, whichever is nearer. Normal damage from the fall applies if the creature hits something solid at the end of the fall. A creature or an object that falls across a gravity plane takes no damage from the fall but begins oscillating from one side of the gravity plane to the other, as described above.

## Weightlessness

In any location where gravity isn't present, the following rules apply:

**Impeded Melee.** When making a melee attack with a weapon, a creature that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed (either naturally or provided by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon deals piercing damage.
**Movement.** A creature can use an action to push off something heavier than itself and move up to its walking, flying, or swimming speed in a straight line. The creature continues along this course, moving in a straight line at its speed on each of its turns until something stops it or changes its trajectory.
