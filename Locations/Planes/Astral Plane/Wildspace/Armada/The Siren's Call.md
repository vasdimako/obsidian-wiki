# Description

“Siren’s Call” was the name of [[Carmilla]]’s vessel and crew. She was a big black pirate ship, with ornate gothic decorations in black and gold. Her sails were crimson and she was lit by black lanterns with a dim purple light. Her figurehead (which granted her name) was a beautiful siren, a female mermaid with huge wings spanning from her back, in a mournful expression. Her flag also depicted a mermaid with bat like wings, holding a skull. The ship was often surrounded by mist.
