## Description
Armada is a floating city made of a hundred ships lashed together. They all have masts and sails that are still functional and can be used to shift the city if absolutely necessary. When Armada is stationary, it uses magitech crystals to alter the weather around it. It can create fog, prevent large waves or even cause a storm to halt any ship's approach. With a combination of magitech and divination, the Grand Gears can locate ships that cross the waters near Armada and send storms or their own fleet against them. Other ships can dock to Armada, with permission, in specially designed areas. Armada is safe enough for members of the five crews, but outsiders are free game unless they're under the protection of one of the captains. Armada's crest, a skull with a pair of crossed scimitars and five stars around it, one for each of the city's districts.

- New arrivals in Armada are taken to docks in the Garwater district, which is very well-kept for consisting entirely of ships. There are also guards from the crew patrolling the streets regularly.
- The Grand Gears district is the smallest, and is by no means residential or tidy. There are no shops or services here, only the Grand Gears library. The streets are lit by magitech lamps and cleaned by magitech roombas - there is evidence of magical technology everywhere.
- The Nocturne's district is enveloped in darkness, covered by a veil of magic that sunlight cannot pierce. It is lit by oil lamps for the sake of non-vampiric crewmembers. The Garwaters patrol this district the least.
- The Sealords' district is only partially above ground to facilitate their business with landwalkers. Most of their dwellings and shops are below ground in ships they have sunk and strapped to Armada.
- The Blackshanks' district is the newest but it is rich and relatively big. It is also the most chaotic, and the Garwaters have trouble keeping the peace. The Blackshanks like to party and spend copious amounts of coin on alcohol and women.


## History

Armada was established when two pirate crews worked together to take over two massive warships and kill everyone on them. They took the cargo but knew not what to do with the ships. They decided to lash the ships together and anchor them in the waters they roamed, as bait and a warning for other sailors. This grisly collection grew as more pirates joined in showing off their trophies into the bustling pirate city it now is.


## Residents

- The Lovers are a pair of captains that rule Armada. They are a pair of half-elves that descend from sea-elves. Their sailing flagship is called the Arrogance but they have also got their hands on and repaired a Lorian airship called Pride, which floats above Armada in a display of pride and power. It is guarded by Grand Gears Battlesmiths and Garwaters elites. Their crew act as peacekeepers in Armada, which grants them immense amounts of power and prestige. Their crew and district is called Garwater. They use the flag of Armada as their own.
- The Grand Gears are a pirate crew led by the Bookwyrm, a red half-dragon. Their part of the city contains all of the knowledge of Armada, and their inventors and tinkerers work with most of the other crews. They were the ones that created the wave-repellent system. Their flagship is called Pursuit. Their ships fly a flag of three gears spinning each other.
- The Nocturne are led by a vampire called Malik. The entire crew offers their blood as tribute to the captain and in return receive superhuman strength, speed and other blessings. Their flagship is called Cruor. They fly a crimson flag the colour of which drains into a goblet, and then turns black.
- The Sealords are a pirate crew that only accepts races native to the sea as its members. Lizardfolk, sea elves, triton, locathah, tortle and other amphibious creatures are welcomed, but landwalkers are shunned. They are led by a triton called Nills, and their flagship is called High Queen of the Ocean.
- The Blackshanks are a crew led by Ramsey Poisson, usually simply called the Fox. They are the newest addition to Armada, making their position the most tenuous, but they bring in unparalleled amounts of gold and plunder to the city and are the second most numerous, after the Garwaters. Their flagship is called the Blackfire.



## Establishments

-   The Grand Gears library is open to the public for a fee, or to allied crews for free. It is a massive library that encompasses ten warships and contains well-organised tomes on tinkering, alchemy and magitech.
-   The Bottle of Rum is a sailing ship converted into a tavern by its owner, Shaddler, who used to be a royal marine captain and retired when his crew was killed by the Garwaters. There is an old pirate here called Sloan missing most of his teeth, a eye and a foot, who has a torn, ragged treasure map to sell to the right buyer. He seems a bit shifty and it's because he's already sold a copy of the map to Tarik Nasser.


## Plot Hooks

-   The group watch as a hooded humanoid drops a Sealord lizardfolk off a mast, a rope around his neck. If they ask around, they find out she is called the Widow and has some kind of vendetta against the Sealords. Nills will pay a lot of money for her head or her identity.
-   There are recruitment posters for master privateers to explore uncharted waters and winds on the Pride.
-   There are wanted posters of Chiara, the Widow and older yellowed ones of [[Mercy]].
-   Nocturne crew members or Malik himself may be encountered in the night, charming, exsanguinating and erasing the memories of other crew members.
-   Shaidar, one of the Flayed, can also be found on Armada around when the shipments leave, though he keeps a very low profile.
