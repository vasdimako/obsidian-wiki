The astral sea is the realm of thoughts and dreams, where visitors can travel through as disembodied souls to reach the outer planes. It is a great silvery sea with swirling wisps of white and grey streaking among motes of light. It is a vast, empty expanse with chunks of rock forever drifting in the void. More commonly, there are magical pools of coloured light that flicker like radiant, spinning coins. These pools are gateways to other planes, 1d6x10 feet in diameter. The plane a pool leads to can be identified by colour, and finding the correct one is a matter of chance; it takes 1d4x10 hours of travel. A traveller in the astral plane can move by simply thinking about it - distance has little meaning, and the smarter a creature is the easier it can control its movement through sheer will.

Another feature of the astral plane is the psychic wind: it is a storm of thought made of lost memories, forgotten ideas and subconscious fears that went astray in the Astral Plane. It batters travellers' minds rather than their bodies. It is first sensed as a rapid darkening of the silver-grey surroundings, which then becomes as dark as a moonless night. A traveller feels buffeting and shaking and, as quickly as it comes, the wind passes and the sky returns to normal. It has a location effect and a mental effect (DC15 Intelligence Saving Throw).

The most prominent denizens of the Astral Plane are the githyanki; their city, Tu'narath, floats through the plane on a chunk of rock that is actually the body of a dead god. Celestials, fiends and mortal explorers can also sometimes be found scouring the plane for a desired colour pool.

## Astral Navigation

One doesn't need a map to navigate the Astral Sea. Here, all creatures are blessed with directional awareness. In other words, a creature can get to where it wants to go by thinking of its destination, at which point it becomes aware of the most direct route to that location. The destination must be somewhere in the Astral Sea or in Wildspace, such as "the nearest githyanki outpost," "the astral dominion of Hestavar," or "Realmspace." This directional awareness doesn't reveal how safe the route is, and the DM decides how far away the destination is and how perilous the trek through the Astral Sea is.


# Cosmology

The Astral Plane connects the Material Plane to the first layers of all the Outer Planes.

## Astral Dominions & Dead Gods

Many gods have dominions in the Astral Sea. These locations typically take the form of floating islands or cities of fantastic proportions. Astral travelers might visit these dominions as they would any other ports of call, though a dominion's divine ruler always knows when visitors have arrived and what their intentions are. Because these dominions are part of the Astral Sea, they are timeless; nothing ages there, and creatures can survive there indefinitely without food or drink.

The Astral Sea is also where one can find the petrified remains of gods who were slain by more powerful entities or who lost all their mortal worshipers and perished as a result. A dead god looks like a gigantic, nondescript stone statue that bears little resemblance to the divine entity it once was. Githyanki, mind flayers, psurlons, and other natives of the Astral Plane sometimes turn these drifting hulks into outposts and cities, many of which are hollowed out beneath the surface.
