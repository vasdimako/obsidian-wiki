# Description

The Shadowfell, also called the Plane of Shadow, is a dimension of black, gray, and white where most other color has been leached from everything. It is a place of darkness that hates the light, where the sky is a black vault with neither sun nor stars. The Shadowfell overlaps the Material Plane and appears similar to it aside from the lack of colour.

It's easy to confuse the Shadowfell and Feywild for the mirror planes of the material plane that reflect death and life, respectively. The bright, often cheerful creatures and rampant plant life of the Feywild and the pestilence and gloom of the Shadowfell lend themselves to this mistake. This misunderstanding is further exacerbated by the idea, held by some, that the Shadowfell is related to the journey souls make to the afterlife. The truth of the matter is that these two planes actually represent the two components of life, as it exists in the material plane: growth and decay. The growth that the Shadowfell is denied leads to attempts at the expansion of settlements, creation of new empires, and even deforesting invariably failing. Non-native creatures to the Shadowfell seem to age incorrectly; developing juveniles seem to gain added wrinkles in the place of added height.

Landmarks from the Material Plane are recognizable on the Shadowfell, but they are twisted and warped---distorted reflections of what exists on the Material Plane. Where a mountain stands on the Material Plane, the corresponding feature on the Shadowfell is a jagged rock outcropping with a resemblance to a skull, a heap of rubble, or perhaps the crumbling ruin of a once-great castle. A forest on the Shadowfell is dark and twisted, its branches reaching out to snare travelers' cloaks, and its roots coiling and buckling to trip those who pass by.

Unlike the Material Plane, the Shadowfell is constantly in motion. Mountains may sink into themselves creating canyons, or forests may move across the plains to relocate itself. To an observer, the plane never changes, but if they leave and come back they will realize that nothing is the same. Even the streets of cities like Gloomwrought morph and change where they lead too, with towers growing high above the city before crumbling into ruins the next day. The Shadowfell is always reshaping itself, and the creatures that call it home reflect that.

Shadow dragons and undead creatures haunt this bleak plane, as do other creatures that thrive in the gloom, including cloakers and darkmantles.

# Day and Night

The day/night cycle of the Shadowfell cycles between Tenshadow and Dark. Tenshadow is the counterpart of day. The light seems to come from many points all through the Shadowfell. Looking down, everyone can see they have ten shadows, suggesting ten "suns" or maybe very bright stars. Looking up, the sky is an endless, starless gray vault. Until Dark.

When it gets Dark, that's it. It's Dark. Lighting a light will force the Dark back a tiny distance. Lighting a candle will create a bubble of normal candlelight with a radius of about five inches... so whoever lit it probably doesn't see it until they move the candle near their face. Lighting a torch means you can't see your feet. If you move your hand in and out of the bubble of light, a high perception check means you can tell that you move almost imperceptibly more slowly in the Dark. Perhaps the experience is, in a small way, like being underwater.

You can't see in the Dark. Almost nothing can. Devils go bump in the night here, because they can't see either. Creatures with blindsense hunt and move completely normally. Light as many lights as you want... nothing will see your blaze until it actually breaks through the wall of your bubble of light.

Then it will eat you, because the only things that dare hunt in the Dark are terrifying indeed.

# Shadow Crossings

Traveling to the Shadowfell is fairly easy and there are many places where an adventurer can slip into the shadows and find themselves standing in this grim plane. The most common places to find these Shadow Crossings are in graveyards, battlefields, and in the bleak corners of crypts, though the crossings never last very long. It is as if the Shadowfell is boiling over, and the bubbles rise and burst into the Material Plane.

These crossings may last a day, hours or years though the moment that the sun touches on them they burn away and they never appear in the same locations. Many of these same crossings are one way, and once you arrive in the Shadowfell, you must find another way home. Sometimes these crossings will only expel shadow-creatures on to the Material Plane before closing. Many communities have been wiped out when a Shadow Crossing appeared in their graveyard, causing the dead to rise.

# Darklands

The darklands are the name for the areas throughout the Shadowfell where the power of darkness is stronger. The Tenshadow never reaches these places, there is only the Dark. In these spots, the power of dread is stronger and it sucks away at all life and color until everything resembles shades of grey. If one finds their way into such a location, you should leave as fast as possible before it sucks away your life energy and kills you.

Most darklands are thankfully temporary, though there are a few that are permanent and are far more dangerous because of it. Here nightwalkers, sorrowsworn and other evil creatures call home and are quick to destroy all life.

# Domains of Dread

In the darkest corners of the Shadowfell are domains of horror and pure evil. The best known is the valley of Barovia, home to the vampire lord, Strahd Von Zarovich. Here, the Dark Powers watch over their prisoners, known as Darklords. Occasionally mortals make their way into these domains, either by the cruel Dark Powers or by unintentionally wandering into a Shadow Crossing. The Darklords are unable to leave these prisons until they can atone for their sins, though it is unknown if that has happened before.

More often than not, the mortals that are trapped in the domain become the plaything of the Darklord, though some are able to destroy the evil and escape. Unfortunately, the Dark Powers are unwilling to allow one of their prisoners to die so easily and will restore the Domain once those mortals leave. The only creatures that know how to travel in and out of the domains unmolested are the Vistani, and they refuse to share their secrets.
