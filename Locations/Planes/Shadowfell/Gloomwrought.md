# Description

City of Midnight. One of the few major cities of the Shadowfell, this port city is slowly sinking into the Skins, a vast peat bog that extends for miles all around it on land. Dark walls keep out the worst of the Shadowfell, and it even has dark walls that wrap around its port with openings large enough for trade galleys to travel through. This port city is one of the brightest lights on this plane and is a common destination for traders and travelers of other planes.

The walls of this city are decorated with macabre skeletons writhing across them, and the entry gates are skulls screaming, their jaws agape as if in agony and they constantly move around the walls so you never know where an entrance or exit might appear. These walls give off a teal light that illuminates the surrounding peat bog and no one knows if the gargoyles that stand watch along the top of the walls are just carved stone or guardians of the city.


# Inhabitants

Inside Gloomwrought, a wide range of creatures walks the claustrophobic streets. Shadowborn, natural mortals who were born in or have adapted to the Shadowfell, make up most of the population. The citizenry also includes revenants---a race of creatures that are partly living and partly undead---and even stranger beings, such as travelers from other planes. Most of the city's citizens are descended from visitors who, for one reason or another, found that they were unable to leave the City of Midnight. More than a few common folk claim descent from a noble exiled to Gloomwrought or a famous captain once marooned in the city. Such history, no matter how illustrious, carries little weight. In Gloomwrought, one must earn a place or come with a reputation already earned. Heritage aside, citizens here suffer from the long term draining effects of living in the Shadowfell. Everyone who stays for more than a few weeks seems somehow faded, washed out like a weathered cloak.

Hundreds of those living in the city are barely able to scrape together enough coins to buy food on a regular basis. Desperate inhabitants turn to crime, and robbery is common. Even in the guarded streets of the noble districts, roving gangs of muggers wait to prey on those who lack proper defenses. Such ruffians kill indiscriminately, since leaving witnesses could result in capture and death.

In the city market, you can find all manner of dark and illicit goods being openly traded on the streets. A strong black market also thrives here. If an item exists and is for sale, it can probably be found somewhere in the City of Midnight. As such, liches, necromancers and other evil creatures will often sail into port and look for rare ingredients for potions, spells and other dark rituals.

Prince Rolan the Deathless, a somber human nobleman, is the ruler of Gloomwrought. He has created a pocket of relative stability within the Shadowfell, a feat some thought impossible, but does not do much ruling beyond that. The true power of Gloomwrought lies with the merchants who keep the city going by selling their mysterious goods.

A group of mysterious creatures called Keepers tends to the city. Little is known about the creatures' origins or intentions, or whom they serve. They have a powerful connection to Gloomwrought, and the locals treat them with fearful respect.

# The Wall

Gloomwrought's outer fortification separates the city from the Skins, the noxious marsh that isolates and protects the city (see the sidebar). The wall is malleable, just like much of the city, and its black stones have expanded and multiplied to keep pace with the city's expansion. The wall also serves to shield Gloomwrought from the body of dark water, known as the Stormy Sea, that extends away from the city to the south and east.

Lanterns that give off a somber green glow are hung on posts outside the wall. These lights keep the monsters of the Skins from coming close and help incoming ships find their way through the seaward wall. But there is also a sickly blue-green light coming off from the wall itself. Portions of the wall appear to writhe, giving viewers the impression that it senses what goes on around it. Faces like those of demons and gargoyles peer out from it, turning to watch passersby, then sneering or leering before retreating back into the stone.

The only parts of the wall that do not shift are the areas around the gates. Each gate is an opening in an enormous sculpture that resembles a skull with jaws agape. Spaced along the inside of the wall adjacent to the gates are guardhouses. A contingent of the Deathless Watch stands on duty at each one. Officially, these guards are here to register anyone entering or exiting the city, but actual enforcement is uncommon for typical travelers. The officers on duty are more likely to take a few coins than a name. Despite their evident disinterest, the guards are, in a way, vigilant.

# Districts

Six major districts make up Gloomwrought. They share traits with the larger city, but each one also has distinct characteristics.

**Dust Quarter:** Home to Prince Rolan and Gloomwrought's wealthiest noble houses, the Dust Quarter is a stagnant, cheerless place. Houses are extravagant, but the opulence feels soulless or mournful. It's as if the buildings are little better than glorified crypts. Those who live here are certainly cold-blooded enough to dwell in tombs.

**Drowned Quarter:** This teeming waterfront district has an undercurrent of nastiness that is less obvious than the slime on the harbor walls. Life in the Drowned Quarter is desperate and cutthroat. It turns occupants into coiled springs, ready to attack at the slightest provocation.

**Plaza District:** Gloomwrought's center of trade and home to its main marketplace, the Plaza District contains people possessed of an animal greed that colors their actions. They initially give an open and inviting impression to newcomers, but strained friendliness and overly flattering speech barely mask their avarice and corruption.

**Temple District:** The Reign of Night dominates the Temple District like a brooding dragon. Despite the spirituality here, the quarter has an air of hollowness and menace. It's as if the rituals have no heart, and everyone here is looking for a reason to be offended.

**Fettered Ward:** The Fettered Ward is the entertainment district of the City of Midnight, and it contains a larger number of aggressive citizens than even the Drowned Quarter. The pursuit of sensation is performed with a fervor and a callousness that can take kindhearted newcomers aback.

**Shattered Isles:** These island slums of Gloomwrought's harbor, also called the Ghost Quarter, are plagued with hopelessness. A pervasive feeling of inevitable decay and unavoidable failure weighs on those living here.

# The Sever

The most serious threat to Prince Rolan's rule over Gloomwrought came several decades ago when a group of dissatisfied noble houses plotted to overthrow the prince. When one of those rebel houses switched sides and revealed to Rolan the impending insurrection, the prince immediately brought his forces to bear against the others.

Just as the two sides began to clash in the streets, a cataclysmic upheaval struck the southern portion of the city where most of the rebelling nobles lived. The entire area was devastated, and its occupants fled for their lives. Parts of Gloomwrought were ripped away from the mainland and ended up as the cluster of landmasses known today as the Shattered Isles. Fighting between the nobles and the prince's soldiers continued sporadically for a short time thereafter, but for all intents and purposes the rebellion was over before it had scarcely begun.

Citizens of the city call this event the Sever---a term that refers to the cataclysm itself and, in a slightly broader sense, the entirety of the short-lived rebellion. No one alive in Gloomwrought today knows for certain how the cataclysm was brought about or who was responsible for it (with the possible exception of Rolan, and he's not telling).
