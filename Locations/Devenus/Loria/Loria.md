## History

Loria has existed for two millennia, and some of its oldest noble houses date back to the founding of the first city. A prosperous nation ruled by an iron but fair fist, Loria had few issues to speak of beyond what is expected until, a hundred and fifty years ago, a cadre of strange insectoid creatures began to make themselves known at the top of the Empire, apparently emerging from underground at Zenar's Fist.

Lorian military and magical might was more than enough to initially hold back the creatures, but the single-mindedness with which they fought and their continuous evolution into more and more advanced forms became a worry to the Lorian generals. Even more worrisome, some Lorian soldiers seemed to defect and join the creatures, some even double-crossing the Empire and letting agents of the insectoids infiltrate Lorian settlements and attempt to assassinate key individuals - sometimes successfully. Examination and interrogation of these traitors revealed they had been infected by a parasitic organism that put them under the control of the Xathi, who all seemed connected through a sort of hive mind.

The Empire's Blackstaffs found themselves unable to stop these parasites from spreading or even magically detect them, and after the situation seemed to get out of control, the Emperor decided to seal the borders of Loria with a magical barrier especially crafted to sever a Xath's connection to the hive mind and effectively kill them, until measures to eradicate them could be taken. A faction of nobles, led by the Emperor's own brother, objected to this plan of isolating Loria from the outside world and fled to Illira with a group of trusted retainers soon after the barrier was created.

The barrier was strong - powered by the Blackstaff's tower in each major settlement, it was seemingly able to keep the Xathi out and kill the parasites that had already infected the Empire, as evidenced by hundreds of people becoming brain dead as soon as it was erected. The barrier also had the unintended effect of affecting the minds of anyone who crossed it, erasing memories of Loria from them. A handful of the Xathi parasites survived the magic and began to evolve, developing a defense against it. These parasites are still spreading across the Empire, and have established a hive-like connection among those infected but independent to the Xath Queen. The infected plot to topple the barrier and join the Queen's forces once again. Xathi attacks on the north border have continued, and the Lorians have simply sat back and watched scores upon scores of insects cross the barrier and instantly die, apparently unable to develop a defense against it.
