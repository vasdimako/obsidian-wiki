Morne, the City of Splendours, is a sprawling city surrounded by high walls. On its west end lies a tall hill the west slopes of which dip into the sea, and its sprawling docks are busy and protected by walls. It consists of several wards:
-   The [[Sea Ward]]
-   The  [[North Ward]]
-   The [[Castle Ward]]
-   The [[Trades Ward]]
-   The [[Southern Ward]]
-   The [[Dock Ward]]
-   The [[City of the Dead]]
-   The [[Field Ward]]

It is a very civilized city with amenities such as an extensive sewage system, clean, well-lit streets and a water system. This is mostly thanks to the Empire's guilds, most of which are based here. The city's famed Walking Statues are also visible among the rooftops.
